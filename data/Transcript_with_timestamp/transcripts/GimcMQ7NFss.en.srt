00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,200
hello my name is matt lacroix marketing

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,880
manager for

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,639
massey ferguson and heston by massey

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,840
ferguson head equipment today i want to

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,120
talk to you about the difference between

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,520
a rotary rake

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,520
and a wheel rake so on the main part of

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,760
the field we had really thick hay

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,199
not huge deal when you come down here on

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,439
the light end of the field

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,560
you can see here with the v-rake what

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,160
happens

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
so you start ending up with two

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,399
different windrows unless you adjust

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,399
your v-rake now nobody wants to get out

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,160
and have to do that all the time

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,520
and when you have this uneven windrow

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,120
almost two different windrows

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,040
what ends up happening is you're feeding

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,559
your baler unevenly whether it be a

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,079
round baler or a small square like we're

23
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,559
using out here today

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,239
now on your rotary rake over here you

25
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,039
can see that when you get down to the

26
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,920
smaller lighter crop part of the field

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,160
you're gonna have one

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,680
solid windrow and you can see the

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,039
difference now the good thing about a

30
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,399
rotary rake is

31
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,640
the crop continues to dry out

32
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,640
while it's in the windrow with a wheel

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,040
rake it makes a roping action

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,640
tying all the crop together it doesn't

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,280
allow it to dry out

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,240
with a rotary rake you can also bail a

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,600
little bit faster

38
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,680
with a small square like we're using

39
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,080
here today with a rotary rate you can

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,479
bale

41
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,080
about a mile an hour faster now yes

42
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,560
rotary rakes do have a little bit extra

43
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,799
cost

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,080
up front but you'll make it back in

45
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,880
quality of hay

46
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,479
amount of drying time in the windrow and

47
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,520
also in fuel savings because you can get

48
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,479
through the field faster when you're

49
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,159
baling

50
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,600
so this is the massey ferguson rotary

51
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,680
rake and you can see how

52
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,040
nice it picks up the crop and it leaves

53
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,560
a nice fluffy windrow

54
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,240
this one's 12 feet so you can make one

55
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,880
pass down one pass back

56
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,040
a total raking width of 24 feet and now

57
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,920
you see our v-rate running here this is

58
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,280
a tin wheel

59
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,119
and you can see the way it grabs the

60
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,240
crop and brings it around in the

61
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,759
almost rope-like action this windrow was

62
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,159
made by our rotary rake

63
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,840
our rk series this happened to be made

64
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,000
by a 12 foot version

65
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,520
one thing i did talk about earlier was

66
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,360
how fluffy the windrow is and it

67
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,479
continues the drying process

68
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,560
you can see inside this windrow the crop

69
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,760
is still able to get some airflow

70
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,440
through there and dry down

71
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,840
so this was made with our 10-wheel

72
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,400
v-rake now inside this windrow

73
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,080
you'll see more of the crop is trying to

74
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
come up when i'm picking up

75
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,920
the other one just picked up real fluffy

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,280
but this one's one to pick up more

77
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,520
down through the crop so one thing

78
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,640
that'll happen when you get into longer

79
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,840
crops

80
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,840
say really heavy rye or bermuda

81
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,879
it will start trying to grab the windrow

82
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
into your pickup

83
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,239
and pull it because it's in a rope

84
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,000
fashion down through here

85
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,599
now there is very little drying process

86
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,640
happening at the bottom of this

87
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,360
windrow because it's all wound together

88
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,280
i hope this demonstrates the value of a

89
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,120
rotary rake versus a v-rake

90
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,800
and what it can do on your operation for

91
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,560
