  "text": "farmer Brad here and I'm out in the high tunnel trying to get some work done on clearing got out here in the high tunnel to help me so out here I ended up putting the chicken tikka and the other side had some vegetation growing aka weeds and this seems like it will be okay so I've also been trying to work all the brush down that way and I don't know if I'm gonna mess with with landscape fabric just partly because I want to be able to continually add manure and things to it and really once you put down landscape fabric you're basically committed to that I also have a couple more holes that I need to fix in the roof there's one over here and then there's one run along there and I'm debating whether or not to just frame out this side it's a frame out this side for the door and just keep it solid since this is where most of the wind comes from and let me show you over here over here is where I plan to put the water sprinkler system right there so the idea is that the water tank would be outside of there the water would come in here and I think I would may just attach the pipe along there on the inside but I'm also thinking about putting electrical long there because I have to get the electrical all the way over to there to power the solenoids that I'll be using for watering the drip tape and then the other concern that I have is since this plastic up here has a hole can I really seal that off enough because what I was going to do is put my electrical panel in here from the solar so in the comments if you can leave me any suggestions what I'm what I'm envisioning is I have a uniball you know strut or that I'll span between here and then I'll be able to put like a piece of plywood in order to keep basically to be able to mount stuff to and then that's where the power panel will be and then I'll store the batteries below right now I just have one battery and this is kind of where the solar would come in part of the reason for that is I plan on putting the solar just out this way and I don't want to have to put it out too far but if you look at these three trees there I'm worried that those are gonna block the Sun from the solar panels so what I'm thinking about doing is cutting that was about five feet off the ground level and then I'll take the straighter part of the top and make raised garden beds out of that and then those three tree stumps I might be able to make like a kid's treehouse platform out of it well that's at least the thought and I have my littlest helper out here she's having fun roaming around and then here's the Kubota tractor it's done majority of the difficult projects here on the farm and then I got the trailer and the generator and then I I take that generator most places and it ends up powering a chainsaw another thing that I'm thinking about doing is sort of flattening out this and putting a 450 gallon water tank on there that then I could put a gutter off the side of this and have it collect rainwater and then use that rainwater to water the chickens in the pasture and that would just be a way of saving me from having a cart fresh water back here so those are some thoughts I think I'm gonna get some concrete tubes or cardboard tubes sort of build a foundation of where those pet those feet on the tower would go and then I would be able to get that secured to the ground and then get the IBC tote up on top of there and then I can have that water tank taken care of so I just wanted to hop on and show you what I've been doing in the high tunnel I still have a lot of work before I'm able to plant and stuff I also have some compost that I'm going to add and I'm gonna add the brooder pine chips to help as a fertilizer as well for the ground but yeah so thanks for watching and have a good night",
