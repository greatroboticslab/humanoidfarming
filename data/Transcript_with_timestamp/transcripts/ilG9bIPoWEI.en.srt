1
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:07,600
which this way so you need three pieces

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:12,679
of wood in here yeah to make one box

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,679
okay so you need three pieces can

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:20,039
open you want me to talk or you going to

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,840
add well this is a

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:27,640
simple vegetable box built on the cheap

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,199
so this is just made

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,320
from uh 7 and 1/2 inch wide I think it

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,719
is redwood fence boards this is just a

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,920
Cedar uh fence Runner

11
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:46,520
2x4 just these fence boards come with a

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,760
uh uh Dogg ear and cut the dog ear end

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,120
off and you have roughly a 6ot

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,600
length and I took another

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,039
board same thing and cut it for my ends

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,640
I just chose 30 in wide a

17
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:05,320
typical vegetable Bend in commercial row

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:08,640
crop is 40 in and they're starting to

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,840
make better use of the ground now with

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:17,640
the Advent of drip

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:20,439
irrigation so this box is roughly 6

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,960
by3 and you can do it as simple as you

23
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,880
want or as sophisticated as you want the

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,079
key is when you're trying to start

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,439
something from seed is you got to keep

26
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:32,439
it wet once you get the seed wet it

27
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,479
cannot dry dry out or

28
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:37,600
you'll stop the germination

29
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,759
process and how much you think that is

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,560
with the

31
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,479
wood uh this here these fence boards are

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,920
you know you can get them between two

33
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:52,280
and $4 Redwood this was about $4 a piece

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:56,320
this cedar 2x4 is like $2 or less for

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:00,560
the whole thing for an 8ft piece 6ft

36
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:04,520
piece uh soaker hose you can use use

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,560
drip drip actual drip irrigation costs

38
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,560
more there's a lot of pieces it's not

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,040
really necessary in a box like this

40
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,519
unless you can get your hands on actual

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,959
drip tape that they use in in commercial

42
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:20,760
farming and they have whole spacing from

43
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,800
everywhere from 3 in to 8 in so you can

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,519
um get the water right to your plant but

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,480
when you're trying to

46
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,680
germinate new seedlings you overseed

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,200
because there's a percentage of seeds

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,160
that are not going to make it you know

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,000
you look on the pack of seeds they'll

50
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,640
say 85 85 is pretty common 85%

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,200
germination rate that mean so you're

52
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,959
going to put more seeds just in because

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,720
none of them all instead of putting just

54
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,360
one seed you would put more yeah there's

55
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,440
a potential that 15% are not going to

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,760
seed okay even if everything's perfect

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,280
just because they are not perfect okay

58
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,159
and then there's other factors outside

59
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,840
here that are going to could cause some

60
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:04,280
casualties as well well okay so I don't

61
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,440
know if you can see in the camera we

62
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,319
have some seedlings coming up in this

63
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,519
first row so now what is that wir in

64
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,040
there for first well that didn't come

65
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,760
with the hose right no this is common

66
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:22,440
soaker hose that is cut at the length to

67
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,519
get one wrap or one line for each plant

68
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,040
line and then I since I I cut it you

69
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,000
know it was a 20 foot hose to begin with

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,439
or something like that cut it just

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,360
bought a

72
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:37,599
uh garden hose repair fitting and a cap

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,560
to cap this

74
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,920
hose and originally I had it just laying

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,959
on the directly on the soil and that's

76
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,599
fine but I thought so that it wouldn't

77
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,720
um interfere with any of the seedlings

78
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,680
trying to come through the ground it is

79
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,000
strung

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,000
wire just off of where the the plant

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,760
line is you can see here's the Sprouts

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,879
coming through so it's just an inch off

83
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,000
to the side hang the hose from there and

84
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,360
just kind of suspends it and then it'll

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,640
just drip let me turn the water on a

86
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,640
little

87
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,280
bit so where is he the Seas already

88
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,800
where is the little sprouting well

89
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,800
here's if you focus on my fingertip

90
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,759
fingertip okay all along this line there

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,360
you see little oh yeah light green

92
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:35,160
starting to come through oh yeah

93
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:38,000
nice yeah I think this was uh spinach in

94
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:43,280
this first row and that's a pretty quick

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,120
germinator we have uh carrots cilantro

96
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,320
and I forget what the fourth one is in

97
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,280
this box kale I think no kale no we were

98
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,759
going to save kale for a bigger box but

99
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,440
things most of these types of vegetables

100
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:59,320
are between 7 days to 2 weeks and

101
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,520
temperatures yeah is a factor there

102
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,360
there's a about uh 8 cubic yards of soil

103
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,320
in here and you could see it could hold

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,120
some more but it's really not necessary

105
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,360
to fill it to the brim this is plenty

106
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,680
but a little higher doesn't hurt either

107
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,600
the purpose of the box for one thing is

108
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,080
the one of the main reasons is it will

109
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,600
warm the soil quicker than it will warm

110
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,960
the soil on the flat ground the sun can

111
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,759
hit it from all sides it's isolated it's

112
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,720
a smaller

113
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,560
smaller unit so it'll warm up quicker

114
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,600
that speeds up germination helps

115
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,960
uh helps them get through the cold

116
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,520
nights it's like a moisture yeah plus

117
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,600
yeah

118
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,720
so the wire you just added it there you

119
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,680
attach it with a nail right yeah I just

120
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,440
use some roofing nails on the ends

121
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,759
because they have a wider head and

122
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,039
that'll act act as the anchor it's

123
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,960
nothing fancy I just cut some of the so

124
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,759
I just Twisted the end around put some

125
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,520
tension on it didn't have to be

126
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,080
overtight and I just you can use

127
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,599
anything you want if you have little uh

128
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,639
ties like for closing bags in the

129
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:15,240
grocery store those kind of twist ties

130
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,039
that's fine I just cut some of the same

131
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,120
wire to make my my hanger there so you

132
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:23,080
had before you had it right on top of

133
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,120
the soil now you lift it up so it could

134
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,120
uh for what

135
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,840
reason oh just

136
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,720
to just in case the hose is laying on a

137
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,880
Seedling it could you know it could

138
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,800
break the head of the to protect it of

139
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,639
the of The Little Seedling as it's

140
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,759
trying to come through the ground but

141
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:45,199
they're actually stronger than you think

142
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,919
I mean they can push a dirt clot out out

143
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,759
of their way sometimes when they're

144
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,319
trying to get to the sun they can

145
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,440
actually push a dirt clot out of their

146
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,560
way of course there is a point where

147
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,919
they will just so the reason they sprout

148
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,919
is because they're looking for light

149
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,599
right for the sun yes exactly very

150
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:05,919
interesting yeah um what about how much

151
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:08,599
with the whole bik with the so is what

152
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:13,919
cost them if they wanted to do it to do

153
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:15,759
one box like this is probably F the wood

154
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,919
you got to buy a soaker

155
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:23,479
hose uh spool of wire box of

156
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,160
nails

157
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:29,560
um you know 50

158
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,720
$60 that's not bad so and you the only

159
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,960
only reason I chose Redwood is it's

160
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,080
stands up to being wet better same with

161
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,199
this cedar fence post they they can

162
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,280
handle moisture I mean that's what

163
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,160
they're made for is why they why they

164
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,199
use it for fencing so they're more like

165
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,039
water resistant I mean weather resistant

166
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,440
right yeah they don't they are slow to

167
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:54,599
rot from contact with

168
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,520
water what about the soil now uh you can

169
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:00,479
buy organic soil right this is the next

170
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:04,080
bik you're going to do yeah

171
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,360
there's these are 1.5 so 1 and A2 cubic

172
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,840
feet bags of

173
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:13,120
organic garden soil you don't have to

174
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,879
use that but

175
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:22,080
uh any good it needs to be a top soil

176
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:24,319
not not a soil for uh house plants so it

177
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,120
needs to have a little more uh this is

178
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,919
it says flower and Herb so that's what

179
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,440
you need right flower herbs right here

180
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:37,719
so how many bags well the these are one

181
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,719
and A2 cubic feet so we got one two

182
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,599
three four five six six of them this is

183
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,760
probably a little more than we need but

184
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,040
we didn't get this first box very full

185
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,760
either uh here's our three fence boards

186
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,519
you can see the dog dog ear we'll just

187
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,519
cut that off to get a nice Square in and

188
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,600
that that was the length I used the

189
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,000
begin and then you take one and cut it

190
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,240
in half right

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,320
for the yeah create create the end uh

192
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,880
cut it in half cut it whatever you you

193
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,160
decide how many rows you want to put in

194
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,120
there and you need to look at what

195
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,040
you're growing to determine how much

196
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,839
width you need uh look on the packet of

197
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,200
your seeds if you don't know and what

198
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,360
the what the suggested row spacing is so

199
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,600
you some things like to be crowded and

200
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,000
other things they need some room to

201
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,040
breathe so this right here this is I'm

202
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,640
talking about organic or organic soil

203
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,040
and the wood it would be about 60 if the

204
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,360
one it started right yeah yeah the

205
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,519
organic soil's a little bit more money

206
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,680
and what on this next box what we plan

207
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:47,640
to do is put uh food waste you know the

208
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,720
husk of avocados banana peels just you

209
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,320
know all that kind of food waste you

210
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,720
have from preparing meals I'm going to

211
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:59,440
actually put it in the bottom of the Box

212
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,480
before we put the soil in okay and that

213
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,120
as that decomposes you know that's going

214
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,079
to release nitrogen and and other

215
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,079
minerals into the soil so we're going to

216
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,800
we're going to do it we're going to show

217
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:11,279
them how to do the bags you're going to

218
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,279
put it cut it put it together and then

219
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,320
add the um leftover leftover

220
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:21,279
right the from the juicing waste yeah

221
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,800
from juicing all that pulp that's left

222
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,920
we're going to food scraps and that's

223
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,720
what is that

224
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,600
called well it it's almost like

225
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,399
composting campus okay like campus

226
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,920
that's what you're going to do campus

227
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,760
which is very good uh it's like a

228
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,440
fertilizer it works as a fertilizer yeah

229
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,160
when the food waste decomposes it's

230
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,079
releasing nitrogen and other minerals to

231
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,000
the soil so it's very very important you

232
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,639
use that instead of

233
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,200
fertilizers and so we'll come back I

234
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,800
feel like that guy from California

235
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,399
what's the name uh huser huser welcome

236
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,800

237
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,600
together

238
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,040
