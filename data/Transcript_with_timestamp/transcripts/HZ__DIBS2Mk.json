  "text": "all right thank you done and I appreciate Doug really introducing this because we went from someone who's directly into production Doug who's got the extension background but what I really appreciate is that he introduced the idea of looking at the digestible matter how the animal itself functions and using that to inform what we're going to be seeing in the Muar the reason I say that is in my position here at Carleton state I'm actually at Hamilton Trish missed even though I do have background in crop science of soil science my primary function is as an animal nutritionist so my talk on manure comes from my training and nutrition but then also a look at what happens within the animal and how's that going to inform the rest of this so my experience of service comes from research I did one on cattle but to coming up with a book chapter talking about small ruminants and other room animals and their manure production for a book that the crop science aside is about to release on animal manure first one really introduce you to the extent of management when it comes to these animals the best information out there when it comes to what is it like to raise deer or rain servants as a life subspecies comes out of Texas a meal when they put together of that publication we were looking at about seventy eight hundred deer farms across the United States and they certainly had several the big four that they discussed though or the white-tailed deer the L the fallow deer and the red deer and there's some different management considerations that go along with that now before it just sounds like you know I'm using Texas A&M betta I'm living in Texas before that sounds like a Texas talk yes if we look at the map the largest concentration of farms do exist in the state of Texas but it's not an isolated incident if we look at the second-most we've got to go over to the East Coast you look at Pennsylvania and then third-most we end up going up the Minnesota so it is really more of a national consideration not just an isolated incident now one thing I'll tell you is to wrap your head around this you've got to imagine what this farm looks like I'm very much like Aaron some of the others most of my background is in your more traditional livestock so I imagine a beef cattle operation but you have to kind of change that imagination a little bit when it comes to looking at the raising of beer and of the other servants usually we're dealing with very small concentrations of animals with the exception of fallow deer of you're going to be split in roughly thirds you're going to have a third of your population dedicated bumail a third to the female and a third to the offspring balladeer a little different and what I tribute this to is just the size of the animal it's easier to have a lot more animals existing but if you compare this to most of our other livestock species that's not a really big operation that we're looking at in terms of the male so it is a much different scenario and a lot of that's got to deal with management versus our other livestock species if we take that management operation so we take that idea of management and try to translate it moving into the farming characteristics and then even into the animal manure there are certain costs that are just going to exist and we can take it from the economics all the way down to the manure if you look at this ikanai and breakdown that came from that publication about 40% of your costs are going to be sunk in the capital 40% operational there's not I'm really much you're going to categories like I said my background is in nutrition so the one that I tend to pay attention to its feed feed cost in my view are the one thing that you can look at that is a variable is something that can be changed that you can look at and it's going to more likely inform what you're looking at on the manure side again it would picture this comparing it to other livestock we would expect that farming of deer or farming of servants would be more related to a very extensive operation we will be looking at wide open spaces this is where I'm going to directly kind of be your back cattle just like you have cattle if you imagine the cow calf scenario where you have more extensive pastures where you got them roam more freely freely and on time more of a grazing type scenario that does exist that's going to be more on the sporting side of raising deer if you're looking at the breeding side so just like our other two presentations especially alligators where you have the breeding versus the raising the breeding operations are going to look more like a confined operation so we're going to be imagining more of our bullet test or our feedlot scenario now what are the particulars when it comes to the individual species well it really depends on the mindset if you look at the mindset when it comes to raising red deer or elk the primary reason that these animals are raised has to do with a consumer demand for healthy meat alternatives and when I say healthy understand that I'm saying a consumer demand for a leaner meat source a leaner meat source compared to beef let's say when you're looking at these animals the other thing to consider and it's with all of these species these species are suited to land that we can't necessarily attribute to directly to crop production or even to raising our other livestock species and that's because these animals are considered to be browsers if we classify our eminent animals and classify these of browsers that means that they survive on marginal land they're able to consume things that we would not feed their other livestock I'm not going to send cattle out expect them to browse all leaves off of trees or bark off trees where these animals would so their suitability for marginal land really sets the most refer from some of those key areas where we can't get a lot of other agricultural production we shift our mindset a little bit when it comes to the white-tailed deer and that's because the whitetail is not so much a focus on healthy meat offer news but more a focus on the sporting aspect we're looking at operation of hunting rancher so we've got some ranches that are going to focus solely on breeding those animals selecting four of the marketable characteristics and then we're going to have operations that are just going to focus on trying to market them to the consumer so marketing guided hunts now I've spent a lot of time talking about management it sounds like I'm teaching a production class of deer and that's really not where I'm going I want to set you in that mindset of what's happening on these operations because as we look at raising the animal that's going to inform what happens with the manure and this is where I get them uh point that expression of the manure nutrients is going to revolve around two things two identifiable things that we can look at and that we can change what is going to be diet composition and the other is diet digestibility those are both things that we can control when it comes to raising these animals because as we shift that composition so will we shift that digestibility putting together data for this we start to look at what is typical of these animals and I'm going to split them out just like I hit on the management side and talk about the red deer and the elk versus the white-tailed deer if we look at the red deer and elk we're looking at their intake and they're going to be consuming somewhere around five percent of their body weight a day although while they're consuming of that five percent about half of it is going to be digestible so we focus really on these two numbers and then when it comes to what we're concerned about with a manure either on how do we handle that Anouar or how is it distributed this becomes our other big one we're looking at what's the digestibility of crude protein than that maneuver so instead of just throwing some numbers at you I want to give you an illustration let's go through an example let's say that we're working with Red Deer we're going to assume that that deer weighs about 440 pounds all right I said the first thing that we could effect was the diet so we're gonna look at the forage they consume while we're I told you about how much they consume so of this we say that that 440 pound animal is going to consume 6.2 pounds of dry matter now if we're looking at fresh forage that's going to be about 13 pounds of fresh forage but when we're looking at all this we've got to stay on the dry matter number to keep things eat if we take that then and look at the digestibility our little poop emoji tells us that we end up with two point nine pounds of dry matter in the feces that's just giving an expression of that 52% by disability so this is per animal per day if we're dealing with a confined operation that could tend to build up over time if we're looking at extensive operation so more of a pasture based system that's not as big of a concern but let's look more into the characteristics of that manure let's say that the forage that they're consuming this is marginal land so we're going to be low crude protein we're going to be under 8% so by seven and a half percent we then know with the crude protein digestibility that manure is going to come out we've got point three one pounds of crude protein makes it through the animal into the manure so we can now characterize that manure that maneuver is now going to be 1.6 percent nitrogen and that's going to be a very similar to a lot of our livestock species where we already use their manures it's fertilizer the difference is going to be that we're dealing with a much drier maneuver and with a being much drier that gives us a lot of opportunity if this maneuver is collected so if we're in the breeding operations where the examples are in confinement that gives us a lot of opportunity that can exist there the reason I go through all of this I don't want to give you some comparisons it depends but it's not a servant operation what you're doing if we look at the white-tailed deer we've got a completely different scenario their intake is roughly the same we're within a half percent of body weight or 0.8 percent of body weight digestibility roughly the same so I wouldn't consider these two numbers to be that unusual those are nearly consistent across the board when it comes to serving a livestock what I want to point out though is the crude protein digestibility research that has been done on these species on the feeding side shows that white-tailed deer are much more efficient at nitrogen at nitrogen utilization so let's go through the same scenario let's take our white-tailed deer at 125 pounds so smaller animal with it being a smaller animal we already know it's going to consume less so we're going to cut our consumption down from six pounds to two pounds cut it in 1/3 with that digestibility we end up with one pound dry matter extrusion now this becomes a manageable number whether we're extensive or Ian tenses this is a number that we can deal with and we're not going to have a manure buildup as quickly the interesting thing comes though in crude protein that same forage that we would have fed the red deer and we would have ended up with a manure that was 1.6 percent nitrogen now we've got a manure that's 1 percent nitrogen we're able to use this manure more extensively lower nitrogen concentration yes it means that you're not getting as much bang for the buck when it comes to manure nutrients but you're also not limited as much on how much can be applied I take you through these calculations because if we look at what's publishing the literature I'm going to echo Doug on this one those'll saying that there's really not much out there on manure characteristics of alligators his was none my talk is not necessarily nothing we did have some but to say it's limited as an understate there's one thing that Aaron brought up the other day when she and I were talking about this there's zero information out there about deer urine and we all know that when comes to the total nutrient management prospect that urine can have a big impact especially when we talk about nitrogen relations but if we're just leaving manure characteristics I take you through that because it illustrates where we're getting these numbers we were able to calculate that one to two percent nitrogen that was going to appear in the manure we were able to account for that load or the high dry matter percentage low moisture in the feces so it's just a way to illustrate a time together of that relationship between feeding the animal and managing the app and that concludes my talk on servings I believe now I turn it back over to Aaron",
