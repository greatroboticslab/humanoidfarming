Jane I'm the head of content here at

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,880
Food unfolded economic instability is

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,160
one of the greatest struggles farmers

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,139
face it is also one of the greatest

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,300
barriers to more sustainable food

8
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,820
protection if farmers are to meet

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,340
legislative and consumer demand for

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,260
producing more with minimal impact or

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,960
even positive impact on the environment

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,840
we need to First address the realities

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,260
and challenges related to the costs of

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,260
farming

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,160
of running a farm varies depending on

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,200
the size and product of the farm you can

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,780
probably guess certain expenses like

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,660
fertilizers pesticides hired labor

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,539
tractors and Machinery feed if it's a

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,079
livestock farm and so on but what about

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,899
land use fees like rent or mortgage fuel

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,300
crop insurance loans on new Investments

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,760
repairs and maintenance veterinarian

24
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,520
costs software and other monitoring

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,939
tools depreciation certification and

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,400
compliance costs and soap these expenses

27
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,740
are all necessary to keep a farm up and

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,900
running and ultimately affect the

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,080
remaining income and profitability of a

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,080
farm

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,960
so how much do you think a farm makes on

32
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,520
average in 2018 the average net income

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,860
in the EU was 22 500 euros this amount

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,740
includes subsidies production and labor

35
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,619
costs and depreciation but excludes

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,900
income tax the most significant income

37
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,540
differences are Regional and product

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,759
specific the Netherlands Denmark and

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,920
Luxembourg had the highest income on

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,560
average while Hungary Poland and

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,900
Slovenia were lowest when it comes to

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,420
products the ranking of income highest

43
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,299
to lowest was Farms specializing in

44
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,420
granivores pigs and poultry wine

45
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,579
Horticulture Dairy while permanent crop

46
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,579
farms like almonds and pistachios

47
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:06,000
grazing livestock farms and mixed Farms

48
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,799
were below the 2018 average another fact

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,500
to consider is that many farms

50
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,319
traditionally rely on unpaid labor in

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,260
the form of family labor and in the EU

52
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:19,680
unpaid family labor accounts for 7 24

53
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,480
percent of total Farm labor hours to

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,940
help support farm income many

55
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,680
governments issue subsidies while there

56
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,319
are issues related to subsidy

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,360
distribution see our previous video on

58
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,760
how subsidies and policies impact food

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,160
production these payments are intended

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,160
to cushion the impact of fluctuating

61
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,800
market prices and provide some stability

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,200
for Farmers but it's still often not

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,080
enough with Farmers juggling thin profit

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,120
margins growing expenses loans and

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,400
increased interest rates many of them

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,480
have chosen to close down and sell their

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:59,340
Farms between 2005 and 2020 the EU lost

68
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,319
around 5.3 million Farms 87 percent of

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,260
these were small farms under five

70
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,180
hectares and today all farmers are

71
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,000
facing another challenge of inflation

72
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,159
with climbing Fuel and fertilizer prices

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,920
many farmers struggle with financial

74
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,800
forecasting can they invest in new

75
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,420
technologies new infrastructure or can

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,819
they even afford to change their

77
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,280
practices to be more sustainable which

78
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,920
often requires an initial investment of

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,659
time and money Farmers from lower income

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,120
regions will struggle with additional

81
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,340
social impacts as increased expenses

82
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,040
means less money available to higher

83
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,040
labor and less money to improve housing

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,720
education or Health Care some of these

85
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,940
farmers will turn to other activities

86
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,580
like cutting down forest trees and

87
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,920
commercializing wood

88
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,260
to create alternative sources of income

89
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,480
some Farmers have turned to carbon

90
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,819
farming in which they receive subsidies

91
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,459
or payment schemes for sequestering

92
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,920
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere via

93
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,720
planting specific crops or trees in

94
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,239
Europe farmers are also hosting

95
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,519
educational events creating campsites on

96
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,060
their land or even producing artisanal

97
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,980
food on site like cheese or oil Farmers

98
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,659
might also switch to organic production

99
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,120
or other sustainable production

100
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:17,400
practices as such products generate

101
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,220
higher prices and more financial support

102
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,100
from subsidy programs like the eu's new

103
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,680
common agricultural policy which rewards

104
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,180
Greener practices and despite lower

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,479
yields compared to Conventional

106
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,419
production Organic Farms have saved 75

107
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,540
to 100 on pesticide costs per hectare

108
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:38,460
and 45 to 90 percent of fertilizer costs

109
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,100
per hectare when including the price of

110
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,680
their products and subsidy support EU

111
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,800
organic farmers saw a higher or similar

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,380
income can consumers like you and me can

113
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,419
also support Farmers by directly buying

114
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,120
their products either at markets or

115
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,040
through subscription services this cuts

116
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,440
out the intermediaries and allows

117
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,720
Farmers to keep a greater percentage of

118
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,520
their profit if you're interested in
