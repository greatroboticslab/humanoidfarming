  "text": "if you have been dreaming of having a balcony Garden Oasis here are five tips to help you successfully care for plants in containers growing Joy hi plant friends I'm Maria your new best plant friend and I'm here to help you care for plant successfully but most importantly grow Joy while doing so and there is nothing more joyful than sitting on your balcony with a mocktail or a cocktail at dusk enjoying scented herbs blow in the wind maybe some cut flowers I've been balcony gardening for the last four or five years the first balcony I gardened on was 9 Square ft in New York City it was basically this big now I am lucky enough to have this epic balcony that's about 150 square feet that I grow most of my fruits and vegetables over the summer I have learned a lot in these four years so I wanted to go over my top five tips to help you have a successful first year or maybe second year gardening tip number one is going to be to utilize your vertical space a lot of balconies you really don't have that much space right so use every inch that you have as you see I'm using my balcony railing in two different ways I have these hanging planters that I'm planting on and I also am actually using it as a trellis so I have little cucumbers here that will grow and start trellising across the balcony also if you don't have a balcony railing that is slatted like this that you can actually use as a trellis make sure that you use trellises so I'm planting way more food in this one container because I have a trellis that the center plant is going to grow up then I can utilize the side space so it doesn't like Bush out and it actually grows up and you just can get more bang for your buck out of one container tip number two if you're growing in containers they're going to dry out faster so you need to understand how you're going to sustainably water all of your plants throughout your summer when you have travel involved right who doesn't have a million weddings to attend this summer so you can do that in a couple of different ways if you you could either do self-watering Planters these are self-watering Planters they have a watering Reservoir you fill them up with a hose and then these can go like one or two weeks without having to water the plants over and over and over again it's great for if you travel if you're not going to do that here's a watering hack that I do when I water my grow bags grow bags particularly are amazing for container gardening but they do dry out faster than any other container out there have two watering cans usually if you have more than one container it's helpful to have one watering can that you're watering in this will fill up in the sink as you're watering and then you can swap it out it'll just make watering less time consuming if you have two also these aren't fancy watering cans I literally bought this at the dollar store a couple of days ago tip number three intensive plant if you want to grow a kitchen herb garden on your balcony a lot of people that's the Gateway into gardening you have a little balcony with a little bit of sun you want to grow some herbs there's nothing better than cutting chives and scrambling them into your eggs that day or or harvesting fresh cut basil for you know a little garnish or making your own pesto with so if you are going to have a kitchen herb garden you can plant your herbs pretty close together it's called intensive planting because you're going to be constantly harvesting from them you're basically pring the plant on a weekly basis so you don't need to listen to the guidelines on on the plant tag so in this one container I have oregano parsley cilantro rosemary thyme Sage micro dorf Tomatoes I have lettuces on the outside I am using every square inch of this planter to get the largest yield of Edibles that I can because when you're on a balcony you got to make use of your space right number four be mindful of the varieties that you choose when balcony and container gardening I have an entire salad worth of food in this one container because I've chosen micro dwarf varieties when you're at the Garden Center it's either going to say dwarf variety patio variety or container variety those are plants that have been intentionally br to have be more smaller and compact so you can grow them in small spaces as an example this is the kitchen minis red velvet micro dworf tomato it's only going to get like 12 Ines tall maybe this big I'll get a ton of tomatoes off this plant but it's just going to be super small in here I'm growing a quick snack cucumber so it's a Vine it's going to climb up the Trella so it's not going to take up a lot of space it's going to grow mini cucumbers right so these are all mini plants I have a mini um bell pepper plant the kitchen mini fresh by spites orange sweet pepper and then I also am growing Tom Thumb lettuce which is like a more compact lettuce so I have a ton of plants in here and the reason why I can plant them all together is because they're all micro dorf patio varieties so they're going to take up less space Also if you want to grow flowers you definitely should if you're trying to grow food right because if tomatoes need pollinators to make sure that you get a lot of beautiful fruit so I have small edible flowers like these violas also if you're looking at the Garden Center make sure sometimes if you get a Zenia for example it'll be a container Zenia or a patio Zenia or you can just look at the tag to see how tall the plant gets if you're trying to grow a flower I wouldn't grow a flower that gets over like 12 or 16 inches tall Zenia is a great example you can buy a Zenia that can get four feet tall or you could buy a Zenia that can get 10 Ines tall so read the packet before you buy this isn't a packet this is a plant card and last but not least my find the shade that your balcony railing or other balconies around you can provide in my first apartment in New York City when I had that tiny balcony I mentioned it was an apartment balcony there was a balcony on top of us a balcony below us so we were actually shaded also understand your exposure so this balcony this uh this is South the the sun rises in the East sets in the west so we get really strong Western Light um these plants pretty much get direct sunlight for eight hours a day but if you have a balcony that faces the north it's going to be a lower light situation right so you need to see do I have unobstructed views of the Sun or do I have a balcony or another building blocking the Sun for my plants and then also what is the railing doing to my plants so if you see this this is an elevated garden so it's amazing because this railing is never going to cast shade on this planter however my grow bags over here might get some shade because at the point where the sun is over there they're going to be in a little bit of a shadow so be mindful of the exposure of your balcony and then the shade that other elements in your environment might be providing whether it's a building next to you whether it's a balcony railing whether it's balconies above or next to you everybody's balcony lighting is definitely a unique snowflake so you're going to have to do a little bit of sleuthing to make sure that you set yourself up for success and a general rule of thumb is most edible plants need about 6 to8 hours of direct sunlight you can get away if you don't have that much you can probably try growing lettuces and some tender herbs and be okay but that's also something a quick Google can answer for you one bonus tip enjoy your balcony Garden sometimes this can get very stressful right I'm giving you these tips to set you up for success but also some of the best lessons you can learn about growing from plants come from plant plays I always try and grow something I've never grown before every single year to continue expanding my knowledge and enjoy yourself enjoy the aromatic herbs that you're growing enjoy the the beautiful blooms that you're growing I hope all of these tips help set you up to have a restorative Oasis amidst your probably busy Urban environment that you're living in and that this summer whatever you grow you keep growing Joy",
