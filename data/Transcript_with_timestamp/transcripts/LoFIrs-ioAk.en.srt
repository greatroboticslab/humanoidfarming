00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
hello everyone Rob Greenfield here in

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,140
the garden and today I'm going to share

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,670
my tips for beginner gardeners so if you

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,620
are out there feeling like you have a

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,349
black thumb feeling like whatever you

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,020
plant dies and you are dreaming of

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,789
having a green thumb dreaming of growing

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,000
and abundance of food and having that

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:33,840
fresh food on your table to eat then

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:35,489
this is the video for you I actually

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,530
feel like I'm in a really good position

12
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,989
to be able to share these tips with you

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,239
and the reason why is it's not that long

14
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,629
ago that I was a complete rookie

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,390
gardener myself go back just three years

16
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,550
ago and I had grown very little food and

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,730
then I launched into a year-long project

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,890
of attempting to and successfully

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,600
growing and foraging everything that I

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,030
ate for an entire year and during that

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,940
year I grew over a hundred different

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,650
foods in my garden so I quickly went

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,590
from a beginner who had grown very

24
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,619
little to a pretty experienced gardener

25
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,780
who has spent hundreds of hours in my

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,210
garden in other people's gardens both in

27
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,759
the United States and in other parts of

28
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,820
the world so I'm in a place where I can

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,549
still remember the nights of frantic

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,939
searching online and calling friends and

31
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,119
seeds not sprouting and plants dying and

32
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:33,060
just that that fear to now having the

33
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,220
confidence and really being way beyond

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,250
that beginner stage so that's why I'm

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,290
really excited to be able to share this

36
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,950
advice with you from a recent beginner

37
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,560
to and now pretty decent gardener so my

38
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,560
first tip is a really simple one and

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,899
that is to start small a lot of people

40
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,850
have this dream of turning their whole

41
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,860
yard into a garden and growing an

42
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,320
incredible amount of food that is a

43
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,380
wonderful dream to have I completely

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,540
support it but what a lot of people miss

45
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,840
out on is the fact that it doesn't

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,940
happen overnight that you go from having

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,099
very little gardening skills to all of a

48
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,770
sudden this paradise achill garden

49
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,319
everybody has to start somewhere and for

50
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,390
a lot of us who don't have gardening in

51
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,860
our background our parents didn't garden

52
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,280
where we're starting kind of from

53
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:26,550
scratch as adults starting small is one

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,590
of my absolute key places for beginner

55
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,300
gardener so that could be in a small

56
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,760
raised bed in your front yard

57
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,400
it could mean you know some plants on

58
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,640
your balcony or your windowsill don't

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,080
put yourself down for any amount of food

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,780
that you grow any amount of food you

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,040
grow is a really positive step forward

62
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,560
so start small and each

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,810
season you can add on more and more and

64
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,239
more and this will also build your

65
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,980
confidence one step at a time if you

66
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,680
start with way more than you could

67
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,650
possibly handle often it gets away from

68
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,829
you you become overwhelmed and then you

69
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,989
just kind of lose it all so if that's

70
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:07,870
the case for you and you don't think you

71
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:10,209
can go big right away absolutely start

72
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,549
small now if you have so much free time

73
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,150
and you really think this is what you

74
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:15,370
want to do

75
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,099
I'm not discouraging you from going big

76
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,920
but definitely one of my number one tips

77
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:23,439
is start small if you feel like that is

78
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,739
what is needed for you at the time next

79
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,829
up is keep it local really try to seek

80
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:32,290
out the local resources the truth is is

81
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:35,109
that the gardening knowledge is almost

82
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,939
everywhere it's often that we pass it up

83
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:38,560
we don't realize that anybody gardens in

84
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:40,840
our area cuz we're not looking for it

85
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,970
and we don't realize it but everywhere

86
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,879
around the country and around the world

87
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:48,250
there are local resources that really

88
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:51,220
know that area well so seek out local

89
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,500
nurseries local seed companies local

90
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,359
gardeners if you're driving around your

91
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,280
neighborhood then you see a garden in

92
00:03:55,359 --> 00:04:00,609
someone's front yard knock on that door

93
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,680
and say hello and talk to them a really

94
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:05,409
great way to go local is community

95
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,810
gardens join a community garden so that

96
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:10,750
you can learn what plants are growing

97
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:13,419
well there get support from them

98
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,919
another thing is local classes if you

99
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,949
can find classes that are in your area

100
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,720
that's a great way to get the knowledge

101
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:22,030
that is based on your area and then

102
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,979
books as well check out your local

103
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,199
library often they will have books that

104
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:28,780
are based on your region or your state

105
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,849
for example when I was in Florida I got

106
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,349
Robert Bowden's book which was Florida

107
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:35,169
fruit and vegetable gardening so it was

108
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:37,180
geared exactly towards my area and

109
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:39,940
leaves out so much of the information

110
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,099
that I didn't need it focuses on the

111
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,919
information that you need keeping as

112
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:46,960
local as you possibly can and then that

113
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,610
moves into the next one and they're

114
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,250
pretty much tied together and that is

115
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,919
garden as a community garden together

116
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,800
there's no reason to do this alone if

117
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,639
you are at home alone doing this all by

118
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,219
yourself and all you're doing is looking

119
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,009
on the internet you know Facebook groups

120
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:06,379
and things like that watching YouTube

121
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:09,069
videos sure those things are helpful but

122
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:11,419
it's easy to feel you know really

123
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:14,330
overwhelmed and unempowered when it's

124
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:16,699
all by yourself so get involved with

125
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,340
others when I had my garden in my front

126
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,590
yard I'd have people drive by and I

127
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,169
would see them stop and look and I would

128
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,539
encourage them to stop by one time I

129
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:29,990
even had someone knock on my door and he

130
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:32,210
very timidly said I know this is awkward

131
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,759
but I've been dreaming of starting to

132
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,219
grow food with my kids I just had to

133
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,080
knock on the door and ask and I I walked

134
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:42,020
him throughout my garden send him home

135
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,090
with a bunch of food and gardeners love

136
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,180
that gardeners love to share their time

137
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,219
and their knowledge so get involved with

138
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,020
local people joining a community garden

139
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:53,060
is one of the simplest easiest ways to

140
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,389
do that if you can another thing you can

141
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,250
do is volunteer at local organic farms

142
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,830
there's a website called whooping

143
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:05,089
worldwide opportunities on organic farms

144
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:07,669
it's WWF dotnet and that's a great way

145
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:10,190
to just immerse in local food growing

146
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:12,710
and you can also travel and do it as

147
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,240
well so there is no need to do it alone

148
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,680
the resources are out there that

149
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,710
knowledge is out there that community is

150
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,580
out there gardeners welcome people in so

151
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,949
don't do it alone

152
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,020
do it with community now keeping on that

153
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:26,690
theme of local but moving into actual

154
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,089
plants moving into the planting where do

155
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,689
you source your seeds and your plants

156
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:34,750
for me it's all about local varieties so

157
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:37,909
seeking out local seed companies and

158
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:41,270
local nurseries that have been growing

159
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:44,240
these plants in your region for years or

160
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:47,689
even decades how that works is if the

161
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,490
plant is designed for that area it

162
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:51,020
already knows the insects that are going

163
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,150
to attack it it already knows the

164
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,210
weather patterns this is a plant that is

165
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,310
designed to grow in that area so if you

166
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,289
can buy your seeds from local seed

167
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,050
companies that produce them in your area

168
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:05,839
as well as nurseries this drastically

169
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,569
increases your chance of success whereas

170
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,099
going to the big-box stores and buying

171
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:12,500
the plants that have been shipped from

172
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:15,140
who knows how far away from some

173
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,360
of centralized distribution center those

174
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:20,300
plants might not be designed for your

175
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,910
area for example where I did a lot of my

176
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,520
gardening in Florida big fat juicy

177
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,860
tomatoes like beefsteak tomatoes don't

178
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,550
do well there what does really well is

179
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,190
the small Everglades tomato and with the

180
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,510
Everglades tomato a person with a black

181
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,530
thumb boom green thumb and tomatoes and

182
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,270
incredible amounts but if you're trying

183
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,770
to grow those big ones that are not

184
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:47,090
adapted to that area

185
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:49,340
black them dies molds gets tomato blight

186
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,200
and you don't get anything and you you

187
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,960
know walk away feeling like a failure

188
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,870
so seeking out your local seed companies

189
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,550
and your local nurseries is a huge step

190
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,740
in the right direction when a lot of

191
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,990
people start planning their garden and

192
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,000
they start planning what they want to

193
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,770
plant what they do is they think about

194
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,200
what their favorite foods are and they

195
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:12,169
even walk down the grocery store aisles

196
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,570
and think okay these are my favorite

197
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:17,630
things to eat so this is what I'm going

198
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:20,419
to plant and sure that can be beneficial

199
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,910
but here's the downside of that if

200
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,640
you're doing that most of our grocery

201
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,380
stores are based on globalization where

202
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,900
food is shipped in from all different

203
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,060
regions where it does really well in

204
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,120
this area and not well in that area and

205
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,800
if you do it that way you'll often end

206
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,620
up planting things that just aren't

207
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,300
gonna do well in your area so I think

208
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,130
the best thing to do is instead of going

209
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,110
to the grocery store and asking what you

210
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,530
like to eat talk to people in your

211
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:51,500
community ask them what grows so

212
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:53,300
ridiculously well that you can't even

213
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,010
kill it what grows so well that it

214
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,620
becomes a problem because there's so

215
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:01,850
much of it and plant those things for

216
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:05,900
example here in this garden that I'm in

217
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:09,140
mint is taking over like crazy and I

218
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,420
just made a video about easy plants to

219
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,580
start growing this is one of them plant

220
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,670
what has the fewest pests what grows

221
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:19,730
really easily and then once you've

222
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,290
mastered those easier plants then you

223
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,350
can start to get into the more difficult

224
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,089
ones maybe you love blueberries but they

225
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,379
grow in acidic soil

226
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,420
so if you don't have a civics oil you

227
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:31,819
don't want to start there but once you

228
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,550
get more experience then you can work

229
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:36,410
with changing the pH of your soil that's

230
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,029
a little bit more advanced gardening so

231
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,009
again with the grocery store we've

232
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:42,499
become disconnected with the seasons

233
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:44,809
being able to get most things at any

234
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,790
time throughout the year but one of the

235
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:49,399
absolute most important things is to

236
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:53,600
plant the right things at the right time

237
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:55,550
if you try to plant tomatoes early on in

238
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,980
the spring while it's still very cold

239
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,689
and the soil temperature is really low

240
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,759
you're gonna have our time because in

241
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:04,120
colder climates they like heat the same

242
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,009
goes for basil that's gonna be later on

243
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,949
early things for example kale can be

244
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:12,439
started earlier and actually in very hot

245
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:14,329
places it doesn't do well in the peak

246
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:15,199
heat because it likes the colder

247
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:16,939
temperatures

248
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:19,970
so it's really important to plant the

249
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:21,889
right things at the right time and you

250
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,230
don't have to figure out each individual

251
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:27,290
plant what you have to do is simply find

252
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:30,050
a planting schedule you can check at

253
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,059
local universities often their Extension

254
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,639
Program will have a planting schedule

255
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:37,129
some community gardens will have them

256
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,170
and you can also just go online and

257
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:42,649
search for for example if you live in

258
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:44,240
New York New York planting schedule and

259
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:47,360
this will help you to plant the right

260
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,389
things at the right time and by doing

261
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,660
that ensure the success of those plants

262
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:55,550
as far as the details like how far apart

263
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,730
do you plant each different thing like

264
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,649
tomatoes or kale or arugula and how deep

265
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,259
do you plant the seeds and should you

266
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,819
transplant as in starting from pots in

267
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:07,730
the greenhouse or in your house or

268
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:09,439
direct sow the seeds into the ground for

269
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,240
that I recommend following the

270
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,370
instructions on back of the seed packs

271
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,920
that you get and really importantly

272
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,959
getting a book for your area which I

273
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,670
mentioned at the beginning a lot of

274
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,740
these books that are based on your area

275
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,720
they give you those details so you don't

276
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,269
have to seek it out for each individual

277
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,889
one so in this video I'm not going to go

278
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:31,699
through those details because they're

279
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:34,490
based on each area instead get a local

280
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:36,259
book for your region and follow the

281
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,540
instructions from the seed companies

282
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:39,420
where you buy those seeds there's a lot

283
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,050
of other

284
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,810
details for example sun and water and

285
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,730
soil you could talk about that for hours

286
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,220
and hours and hours but i want to give

287
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,680
just a few tips on that as far as sun

288
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,530
goes for beginner gardeners i generally

289
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,960
recommend full sun now if you're in a

290
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,520
shaded area like i am right now that's

291
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,430
really difficult there's plants that can

292
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,710
grow well in shade but generally most

293
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,530
plants need a lot of sun make sure that

294
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:10,020
you're not under the shade of a tree or

295
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:12,150
where your house casts shade for half of

296
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,030
the day so before you plant your garden

297
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:17,130
keep an eye on that spot and remember

298
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:19,700
that the Sun changes throughout the year

299
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:22,890
so planting in full Sun as far as water

300
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,660
one of the basic ways to tell if you're

301
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,480
watering enough is when you grab a

302
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,570
handful of that soil ideally it should

303
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,570
stay in a clump that breaks a little bit

304
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:37,050
and it's basically the consistency of a

305
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:39,540
wrung out sponge so watering in the

306
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,910
morning is the best before the heat and

307
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,220
if not the morning then the evening not

308
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,020
in the middle of the day another way to

309
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,000
test if you have enough water as you

310
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,010
stick your finger down into the soil and

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,680
if its moist when you get your finger

312
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,480
down to about your second knuckle here

313
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,130
then that's another sign that you have

314
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,370
enough water if it's dry all the way

315
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:02,340
down it needs to be watered so soil

316
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,140
varies all over the place and how you're

317
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,360
watering whether you're in the desert or

318
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,550
in a very fertile area like Southwest

319
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,920
Wisconsin or in Florida where it's

320
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,230
mostly sand it's going to vary a lot but

321
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,230
those are a few tips with water and

322
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,810
again local resources are key because

323
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:21,360
they're gonna know your soil and then

324
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,850
another one is healthy soil a lot of

325
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,470
people they only focus on the plants and

326
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,450
when they see problems they think about

327
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,280
the plants but the truth is one of the

328
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:33,360
most important things is having healthy

329
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,730
living soil so take care of your soil

330
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,850
take very good care of your soil your

331
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:41,610
soil is your life source to have that

332
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:44,520
healthy and abundant food my next tip is

333
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,140
to make it convenient now what I mean by

334
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:49,260
that is putting your garden in a

335
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:51,420
location where you naturally go if you

336
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,960
put your garden you know a ten minute

337
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,910
walk on the other side of your

338
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,710
property where you can't see it it

339
00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:00,400
easily becomes out of sight out of mind

340
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:02,350
and it's easy to neglect so put it in an

341
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,480
area where you naturally go every day

342
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,640
maybe your front yard right next to your

343
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,800
front sidewalk where every day you have

344
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,300
to walk past it to get to your car that

345
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,940
way every morning and night you're

346
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,680
naturally drawn to it and the same goes

347
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,740
for water making sure that you have your

348
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,810
water source near your garden ideally

349
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,880
whether that's a long hose or if you

350
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,470
don't have a hose right next to the

351
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,020
spigot where you have your buckets or

352
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,510
your rainwater harvesting designing it

353
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,920
so that it has a you know relative

354
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,170
amount of convenience we'll make it

355
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,150
easier to get out there don't put a

356
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,980
whole bunch of obstacles in the way and

357
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,660
this is really important when when you

358
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,040
are getting started and you're not used

359
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,720
to it and you don't have a habit of

360
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,490
getting into the garden and you have a

361
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:50,020
habit of just going to the grocery store

362
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:51,640
it's easy to neglect it when you're just

363
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,350
getting started and you have an

364
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,670
incredible amount of information out

365
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,250
there and it's really hard to choose

366
00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:00,370
which is the right information it's it's

367
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:03,010
easy to be infiltrated by chemical

368
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,170
mindsets the idea that you know you need

369
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:08,170
to spray things that every insect should

370
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,630
die that the soil needs these massive

371
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,030
amount of fertilizers but my tip is

372
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,070
don't fall into the chemical mindset in

373
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,810
my year of growing and foraging all of

374
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,820
my food where I grew over a hundred

375
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,730
different foods I never used a single

376
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,400
pesticide not even organic ones and

377
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:27,250
these pesticides have only existed for a

378
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,680
tiny tiny fraction of all the times that

379
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:32,620
humans have lived off of the food that

380
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,810
they've grown so you can grow without

381
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,420
all of that without needing to have all

382
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:40,570
of this money and this upside resources

383
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,920
and be able to grow in an organic in a

384
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,150
sustainable manner

385
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,810
next I want to talk a little bit about

386
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:49,840
mindset and focusing on a mindset of

387
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:53,110
abundance rather than scarcity because

388
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,630
when you think in scarcity it often

389
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:58,480
creates scarcity around you but when you

390
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,790
design in abundance and you think in

391
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,610
abundance that can actually help create

392
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,459
that abundance a really important part

393
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,279
of that is remembering that

394
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:11,309
in order to have an abundance you have

395
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:14,009
to have done death is a part of the

396
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:16,829
gardening experience so don't be afraid

397
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:19,230
to kill plants in fact when you kill

398
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:22,019
plants think of that as part of your

399
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,759
lessons part of your learning to

400
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:26,100
becoming a successful gardening and in

401
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,649
that way it's not a failure it's a part

402
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,850
of the success but even more importantly

403
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:34,920
remember plants die it's not like

404
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:38,009
especially annual plants like carrots

405
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,050
and kale and collards and broccoli

406
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:42,869
all of these only live for a period of

407
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:45,240
time they have to be harvested and then

408
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:48,209
they die don't think of death as a

409
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,639
failure think about it as a part of the

410
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:52,110
cycle of the gardening another thing

411
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,540
that I mentioned just now I mentioned

412
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,519
annuals annuals are plants that

413
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,889
basically you plant every single year

414
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,139
and you harvest and you have to replant

415
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:02,910
every year perennials are plants that

416
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,399
you plant once and they come back for a

417
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,709
very long time raspberries and

418
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:10,199
blackberries and blueberries

419
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:12,899
strawberries fruit trees like apples and

420
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,329
pears and plums nut trees Jerusalem

421
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:17,579
artichoke rhubarb all of these foods

422
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:20,760
that come back year after year are

423
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,919
perennials so I recommend working with

424
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,409
perennials as much as you can because

425
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,240
they generally take less work they have

426
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:30,179
a lot fewer pests they take less

427
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,700
nutrients and they keep on coming back

428
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:35,669
year after year after year and many

429
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,399
perennials thrive on neglect focusing on

430
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:40,770
perennials is definitely a big tip that

431
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:42,270
I would move towards it's it's often

432
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,909
great to start with annuals

433
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,159
for example radishes they produce in 30

434
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:48,419
days that's one of those easy plants

435
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:51,720
that I mentioned that can give you that

436
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:54,299
boost of success and that confidence to

437
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,690
move forward but as you get better and

438
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,539
better

439
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,580
I recommend moving more away from those

440
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:01,350
annuals and moving more towards the

441
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,840
perennial system so there you have it

442
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,179
those are some of my most important tips

443
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,740
for beginner gardeners there's a lot of

444
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,210
other ones out there but if you just

445
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,240
start with those ones and you remember

446
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,309
to start small start simply maybe start

447
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,830
with just five easy plants that you're

448
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:19,200
excited about and if you do five the

449
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,870
next year and you do five the next year

450
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,180
within a few years time you can be

451
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,010
growing dozens of different species make

452
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,020
some goals make some of those smaller

453
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,880
goals make some of those bigger goals

454
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,820
and use those smaller goals to chip away

455
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,790
at that ultimate success of you know

456
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:38,280
your giant front yard just dripping and

457
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,710
oozing with food absolutely everywhere

458
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,020
