1
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,679
good morning chaps have you seen how

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,160
beautiful it is along that Chesterfield

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,480
Canal it's absolutely stunning today and

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,480
the weather is

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,560
perfect for Brick laying and laying

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,039
concrete so we're going to tackle this

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,960
section this morning I hope you can see

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,960
that it's looking rather dark isn't it

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,559
there we are how's that so I must have

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,360
knocked a setting on the camera so what

11
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,680
I will do in a moment is just pause the

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,960
video and uh sort this camera out but

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,879
yes we are going to start laying the

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,640
concrete and the brick sections down

15
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,359
here uh and in order to complete

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,160
that then I've had to go and purchase a

17
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,160
particular piece of

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,799
equipment so yes we made the investment

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,640
and we've picked up this little

20
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,280
beauty so Chan is here just been helping

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,759
me assemble

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:22,720
it uh look at that £19 from screw

23
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:25,159
fix and well we'll have a better look at

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,159
her in a

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,680
sec there we go we got the white balance

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,159
fixed

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,680
so yeah we picked her up this

28
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:40,280
morning uh she is

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,920
134 L concrete mixer it says on there

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,000
I've always known them as a cement mixer

31
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,640
we've just literally assembled it took

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,399
me about 25 30 minutes

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:56,799
and well that's a fired up she's whisper

34
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,240
quiet whisper quiet so we're going to

35
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,479
drag around the corner get some of this

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,079
sand

37
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,439
and I've got some ballast and whatever

38
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,200
else on the back of the

39
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:11,640
van just there some cement and we'll

40
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,640
start the cementing

41
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,480
process so we've got a first mix in on

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,080
the new fraking

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,599
machine seems to be working all right if

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:31,120
I'm honest so uh this is basically just

45
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,640
uh sand cement no in it I'm just going

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,560
to put a very small Foundation down for

47
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,560
the little wall the retaining wall for

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,200
the uh the herb garden at the back there

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,920
and then once that's done we'll mix

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,519
ballast in with this maybe uh one part

51
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,360
cement one part one and a half part sand

52
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,159
and uh two parts

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:59,040
ballast and that should give us a nice

54
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:00,800
concrete for laying down as a pavement

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,080
for the Dr roll

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,680
got there in the end I've also got a bit

57
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,400
of plasticizer somewhere so we'll pop a

58
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,400
bit of that in as

59
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,760
well oh

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,400
God even plastic tubs come in plastic

61
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,080
bags these

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,080
days don't know what they're

63
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,140
[Music]

64
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,560
thinking oh

65
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:31,000
[Music]

66
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,000
yes there we go

67
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,720
so we're a fair few hours into the day

68
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,360
and we've basically got the wall

69
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,560
built uh it's good enough for me it's

70
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,040
going to be painted so I'm not too

71
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,200
worried about the SM smudging of the

72
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,159
cement on the

73
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,280
edges uh so now for the last hour of the

74
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:00,680
day we're just going to lift lift these

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,400
slabs up here Dot and Dabber laying back

76
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,680
down and then when we come in with

77
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,680
concrete uh tomorrow or the day after we

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,159
can just

79
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,560
pour and fill in the gaps down the sides

80
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,799
that's what we want to do get rid of all

81
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,079
these weeds growing down there and we'll

82
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,320
fill all that in with concrete and

83
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:24,000
cement it's nearly home time

84
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,479
buddy it's nearly freaking home time so

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,240
it's going to be a slow day on the Vlog

86
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:31,960
today because we've been busy just

87
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,360
getting that job done we're anticipating

88
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,960
deliveries

89
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,639
tomorrow and uh we want to really make

90
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,840
sure that those slabs were down and sort

91
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:48,360
of gone off before the drayman walk over

92
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:52,639
them with cask and keg full of beer I

93
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,960
send a Shivam his spine so uh we've just

94
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,400
plowed on with it and I didn't really

95
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,560
get chance to pick the camera up more

96
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,440
than a couple of times so I apologize

97
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,479
for that uh

98
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,520
but I'll show you what we've

99
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:09,280
done so the mixer cleaned put away

100
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,080
worked an absolute

101
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,600
treat and

102
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,120
then if we kind of just shoot through

103
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,800
here we'll be able to have a

104
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,639
look all the slabs that we've got laid

105
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,000
down so these have been relay and reset

106
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,520
they're solid now we're going to pour

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,800
concrete down the

108
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,360
sides and put some of these Quarry

109
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,600
stones in there

110
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,319
to TI all up and then that is the brick

111
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:41,199
wall finished was a bit awkward on these

112
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,639
Corners here and here but what we can do

113
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,919
is lose a bit of that Rubble in the

114
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,319
bottom level out that section there and

115
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,199
then yeah we've got this great big wall

116
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,680
so

117
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,800
initially I was

118
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,360
thinking growing hops up there and then

119
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,520
I changed my mind and I wanted a big

120
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,960
logo up there and then I looked at how

121
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,280
expensive the logos

122
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,000
are you know to kind of get like a

123
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,319
street artist to come in or something

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,120
and paint on

125
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,840
there so I'm toying with the Hops idea

126
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,120
again now cuz I think well there's a lot

127
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,280
of space as you can see so at least if

128
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,720
we put some hops in there they're going

129
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,360
to be rigorous enough to actually cover

130
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,039
the whole wall you

131
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,120
know so we'll see if anyone's got any uh

132
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,960
named hop rise hes any Cascade or

133
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:41,319
shinook or east K Golding even would be

134
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,360
nice um I'd appreciate a few rise homes

135
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,000
uh I'd be willing to pay Postage and

136
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,240
whatever else if people were selling

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,039
them like FIV for half a dozen rise

138
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,199
Helms something like that let me know uh

139
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,960
and if I can get them cuz it's going to

140
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,240
start to sprout very soon if not already

141
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,039
if I can get them in the ground we might

142
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,280
even get some Hops at the end of the the

143
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:08,160
year so I'm just going to pop the camera

144
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,160
back on the tripod and uh wrap it up for

145
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:17,800
today don't go anywhere quite yet so

146
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,759
yesterday I put a post on patreon

147
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,360
telling everybody over there that we're

148
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,520
going to do a tasting test for the New

149
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,479
England IPA because I don't think it's

150
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,080
turned out as it should I think it's

151
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,400
overly bitter

152
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,440
in fact I'm almost certain it's got

153
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,800
overly

154
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,599
bitter and uh today was going to be the

155
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,000
day where we'd had it saged and vented

156
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,520
and we're going to try it out of

157
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,960
Cask we've been sidetracked a little bit

158
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,759
with uh the concr in the new car the

159
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,639
cement mixer all these things that we've

160
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,560
done today which I know I didn't film

161
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,680
much of it I I regret it but it's

162
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,319
difficult because obviously we've got

163
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,360
Jack the Lad under my wing now and kind

164
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:04,720
of have to get him uh set up with jobs

165
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,159
because he's only 18 and he's learning

166
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,319
so I can't just

167
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:12,639
say uh go and get those 15 casks mate

168
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,159
Costick them and uh sanitize them and

169
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,400
fill them up with beer out of that tank

170
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:20,800
every step of the way I have to show him

171
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,080
what to do so it's going to be obviously

172
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,680
it's a it's an apprenticeship

173
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,159
essentially it's training up of somebody

174
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,919
who is uh who's a novice and because of

175
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,719
that um my work days have become a

176
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,240
little bit more hectic so I've not been

177
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,919
able to concentrate as much on the Vlog

178
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,599
don't worry it's obviously just going to

179
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:45,560
be a little glitch you know a blip if

180
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:49,000
you like so um Stuart also forgot to

181
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:52,160
stillage the beer so it's not all on my

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,360
back but he's gone and done it tonight

183
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,079
so

184
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,279
