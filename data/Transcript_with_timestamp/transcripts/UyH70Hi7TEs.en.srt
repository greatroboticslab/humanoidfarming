00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,360
i'm dr liz farkerson i'm working here at

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,280
sardi at the plant research centre at

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,199
the moment i'm working on a grdc project

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,760
that's looking at improving the nitrogen

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,720
fixation of pulses and we're doing that

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,279
through

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,519
looking at the agronomy inoculation

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,279
practice and also development of new

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,800
rhozobia strains

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,279
we're looking at a whole range of crop

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,600
types in the project we've got a big

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,000
focus on the group ef pulses to start

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,640
with because they're growing extensively

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,120
in southern australia so that's the

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,600
fava beans lentils field pea and we're

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,840
also including vetch in that group

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,440
but we're also looking at chickpeas and

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
lupins

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,160
this year we have trial sites over at

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,719
port broughton also at heart and at

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,120
lochsten in south australia as well as

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,359
some trial sites at neil in victoria

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,879
with our collaborators over there at

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,520
fort boughton this year we have a

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,119
chickpea trial so chickpeas aren't grown

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,439
as widely through the southern region

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,520
their history isn't as long here and so

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,439
generally growers need to inoculate

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,520
chickpea crops particularly if they

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,439
don't have a history of the crop in

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,200
addition to that we find that

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,720
anecdotally that chickpea just doesn't

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,560
seem to nodulate

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,600
as well as

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,520
some of the other crops like lentils so

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,200
at the child this year at port broughton

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,119
and also at our site at neil we're just

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,000
looking at a range of treatments that

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,600
might improve chickpea nodulation

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,600
so here we have some

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,920
chickpea plants here and some lentil

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,400
plants over here both collected from our

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,840
port broughton site so

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,920
port borton had a history of both

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,240
crop species but

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,159
it's been growing lentils for many many

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,880
years whereas i think chickpea was only

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,759
grown for the first time three years ago

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,320
and so

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,600
chickpea only has

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,600
around 10 nodules per plant

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,680
at this site even

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,360
with inoculation we were able to improve

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,840
that slightly

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,679
but ultimately we'd like to see better

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,920
nodulation on chickpea than we're

57
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,560
currently seeing on these plants in

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,040
comparison lentils were very well

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,680
nodulated they have not been inoculated

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,480
at all and yet we're seeing 50 or more

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,239
nodules per plant which is considered

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,920
adequate nodulation

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,200
and those chickpea nodules as you can

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,680
see here

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,480
are nice and pink and we're also seeing

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,239
the nodules on both the tap root and out

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,840
onto the lateral roots

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,840
so what growers can consider when

69
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,400
they're growing chickpeas is consider

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,480
inoculating every time unless you have

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,480
an excellent history of chickpea in the

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,160
rotation and you know that those

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,160
chickpea crops in the past have been

74
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,239
well nodulated so an important thing

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,920
growers can do each season for all pulse

76
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,920
crops is around

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,680
10 to 12 weeks after sowing and into

78
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,480
early spring they can consider digging

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
up

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,120
some pulse plants out of their each crop

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,519
have a look at the nodulation and make

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,599
sure the crops are well or to adequately

83
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,680
nodulated that'll help growers make

84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,080
informed decisions about whether

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,760
inoculation is needed into the future

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,319
and there's lots of resources on the

87
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,159
grdc website where they can

88
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,840
access more information on how to do

89
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,840
that and what prizes good modulation
