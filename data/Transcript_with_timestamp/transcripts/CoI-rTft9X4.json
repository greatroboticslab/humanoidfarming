campus at NDSU and today's speaker will be Holly Mobby and I'll be introducing her shortly I have a couple notes of introduction before we begin first of all I'd like to invite you to upcoming webinars next week we'll have a session on the food safety modernization act and it will be led by Dr Kim kolk he is participated in a lot of Advanced Training on fisma so if you're even thinking that someday you might have to be following fisma guidelines please take this opportunity to talk to or to hear from someone who's had a lot of training in that area on the 12th of April we'll be hearing from Dr McGinnis and she'll provide an update on spotted wings asophila following that on the 19th of April for the spring is flying by how to tan low and high acid foods will be provided by Dr Clifford Hall who's a professor in plant Sciences at NDSU and rounding out this series of 10 webinars will be Todd weinman and he'll provide an introduction of Youth to gardening so a very important thing that we all can do is to get this love of gardening down through the younger kids a few Logistics if you haven't participated in one of these webinars before and if you have bear with me a couple minutes um you're all familiar here with the screen now because I've had you raising your hand and so on if you have questions along the way you can go ahead anywhere along the line to type your question into the chat pod that's that little white area usually on the left of your screen or it is on mine and we'll try to track that so that we answer your questions as you go and we will have time allotted at the end of the webinar for any questions and answers and of course I'm sure Holly would be okay with you following up afterwards uh one special plea from Julie here and that's to fill out the short survey at the end of the webinar and that will be emailed directly to your email account where you receive updates on attending this so you've probably received a little reminder you'll get a reminder to take the survey and it'll take you two minutes and I've got some neat prizes to um help entice you to take that survey and now I am very pleased to welcome our speaker I have a few notes about her so I'd like to tell you a little bit about Holly Rose Mobby she is the director of the entrepreneurial center for Horticulture at Dakota College of Bottineau she also is the executive director of the North Dakota farmers market and growers association a past president and current editor of the North Dakota Horticultural Society and co-owner along with her husband Barry and Son Adam of garden Waller's Farm this is North Dakota's only culinary Herb Farm and it sells to grocery stores restaurants and individuals across North Dakota and into Minnesota Garden dwellers Farm has been delivering fresh cooking herbs and education to Consumers for 15 years so with that welcome Holly and thank you for doing a webinar for us today thanks Julie that's really nice of you to absolutely really nice to be here we have such a nice group of folks with us today so I'm kind of excited to tell everyone about the opportunity in growing herbs uh this first slide here is my son and I in our high tunnel filled with uh basil and right now the high tunnel doesn't look like that it's just a black dirt but it has been tilled and it's anxiously awaiting um some seeds growing your old herbs can be a great way to enhance your home cooking or it can be a way to create additional sales for your agriculture-based business herbs are a niche market so you have to know that you have the right place to sell them or the right Market to Market to If you're looking at adding them to your agriculture business but they certainly even if you are not selling at a farmer's market or pick your own or through a CSA they certainly are a great way to enhance your home cooking and they have great nutritional value as well besides your cooking there's a lot of other ways that you can grow and use herbs in your everyday life some of them besides the cooking include of course pea and beverages there are a lot of herbal teas on the market right now to kind of give you ideas on what can be used but many of those things you see in those pea mixes can be grown on your own there are of course medicinal herbs that can be used in cosmetics in in bath bombs and facials and soaps and all sorts of cosmetic items just for the aroma itself such as potpourri's or even we often have people buy Bunches of Basil from us just to take home and put them in a base and put them on their counter because the the smell is so lovely and of course just the beauty and Aesthetics whether that is the beauty of growing them in your garden because they are quite beautiful or using them around the home such as Reeds or door swags or decorations so there's many uses for herbs that you can grow quite easily some of the common herbs that we think of most often of course are basal stage Thyme and cilantro and that's what's represented in the pictures here the upper left with my hands that of course is basil to the right of that is Sage below the sage is the cilantro and to the left of that is time so kind of working clockwise wise around that picture you know it's quite interesting because right now um where I'm at South of rugby close to Esmond we still have lots of snow and and there are places where there are three or more feet of snow on the ground still and we're just starting to get a little bit of open space and and bear dirt back again but in my production field the sage and the time um because they were green and with the straw mulch like you see in the picture underneath the snow they tended to warm up a little bit faster than the surrounding uh bare dirt and so they are out there up and looking good and sage and time are actually perennial they will come back year after year and they're also evergreen or semi Evergreen so if I wanted to today I could walk out and pick some nice fresh sage and Thyme and add them to my supper tonight which is is kind of a added bonus to having that really early green stuff in your garden is being able to taste that right away in the spring other common herbs again starting from the upper left you might think that's Dill but it's not that's actually fennel leaf many times when we're cooking with fennel we think of the fennel bulb fennel bulbs are a little bit more difficult to do here in North Dakota because they take such a long season it can be done but they're long season but it's on a leaf will add just as much flavor to your cooking and Aroma and they make a really nice filler flower in arrangements so we grow a fair amount of fennel Leaf here at the farm to the right of that is the Rosemary our Rosemary plugs should be coming in on Friday so I'll have Rosemary to transplant on Saturday below the Rosemary in the lower right is a Greek oregano it's another perennial the Greek oregano is and that also is out in the field up green looking good and if I wanted to make some spaghetti sauce this weekend which I think I just might I could run out and pick some fresh green oregano in the left and the lower left is mint of course and mint has many many uses uh in cooking and around the home and in Aesthetics so there are a few general rules when growing herbs that kind of go across the board no matter what variety you're growing most of them like Sunny locations and if you think about herbs and there and their purpose and what they're like we like herbs because they smell and they taste good and they smell and they taste good because they have a high amount of oil in them and the more sun that herb has the more concentrated that oil is going to become within the herbs so it's going to have better flavor and it will actually do much better in Sunny locations for most herbs most herbs also like well-drained soil no mint really kind of likes a moist soil not soggy but moist it certainly likes its share of water but other than the mint most of them really on the dry side is fine for most of them most herbs do not need large amounts of fertilizer or need to be fertilized again going back to you know what doesn't kill us makes us stronger and it's the oil in the herb that we want to be very concentrated to give it the best flavor and Aroma and you will get that in uh in a plant that is struggling just a little bit and we certainly don't want to plant them in hard pan clay but you you don't need to worry about too much fertilizer either um there are a lot of herbs that are well suited for containers so if you don't have a spot in your garden or a production lot or a large space and you just want to add them to containers on your deck or your patio there are many many varieties out there that are well suited to container growth some of the myths or semi myths that are out there about growing herbs is that most herbs should be picked right away in the morning right after the duo is gone um while I agree with that and it's a semi miss for you know I agree with it to a certain degree it's not always true what you do want to avoid is the heat of the afternoon you know don't go out on a 100 degree day when the sun is blasting down on things and pick the herbs then because they are very much like us plants are um they have stoma they open and in the same way we sweat they transpire and along with that moisture leaving the plant will be that oil that I've been talking about that gives it good flavor and um good aroma so picking them when it's a little cooler whether that's in the morning or in the evening is fine to stay away from that heat of the day there's another myth out there that says oh you know it's it's blooming so I can't I can't eat it or it's not going to taste as good honestly most herb flowers are edible we make a Great Sage pesto with sage flowers when it's In Bloom here and it really would take an extremely refined palette um to for a person to taste the difference between an herb that was celery and one that was not so if you keep harvesting of course it's going to delay that flowering but actually if if you've gone on vacation and you come home and you find that your herbs oh my goodness while I was gone they started flowering don't let that stop you go ahead continue harvesting and using and eating those herbs anyway um and the last one at downright live when using the followers pick them before they're fully open honestly they will have a a better flavor if you pick them a little bit more in blood stage with any flour the longer it's open the more it declines um and and loses bigger and flavor so if you are going to eat the flowers um actually eating them or picking them choosing them when they're on the more of a bud stage is better excuse me um so growing herbs for season long sales what you need to consider is you will need to plant them in succession a lot of times people with our other garden plants our Flowers and Things They go out and we plant our Marigolds in the spring and that lasts us all season long and that's great but if you are actually in the business of growing herbs for sale you're probably going to want especially culinary herbs you're probably going to want them to plant them in succession in other words you're going to plant the seeds or the plants more than one time and this is specifically true of annual herbs not so much The Perennial ones but annual herbs and we're talking about the basil Dill cilantro those sorts of herbs that are very fleshy they grow very fast and you want them to be nice and succulent keeping records is extremely important and those records will help you from year to year remember okay I planted my first basil seeds on May 15th and I planted the next seeds three weeks later and oh guess what that was a little too close together maybe I should move them now everyone's growing situation is a little bit different so it's extremely important that you keep records of your own plantings so you can gear it towards your microclimate and your soil um one of the things I like to express to people is don't over buy seeds although most herb seeds will last several years without losing a great amount of germination power it really is unnecessary it adds unnecessary expense to your bottom line to over buy those seeds we did you know for years I've over bought seed and I've carried seed over from years year to year but this last year and I'm we really couldn't get a couple of our varieties to grow to save my soul I kept succession planting and succession planting and they just were not doing well and finally I kind of ran a germination test on the seat I was using and looked at the package and went well no wonder it's a couple years old I ordered fresh seed and for the rest of the season we did fine so I really would um suggest ordering only the seeds that you need for a year with herbs you will always have a time when you must either find an alternate use for them or compost them it's the nature of things I prefer when I can to find an alternate use for them of course you know at the end of the season we might have a whole lot of Basil left over it's just been that kind of a good growing Year I'll go out you know gather bunches and make up a lot of pesto and freezes there are some of our other herbs that I'll gather together and make wreaths for around the house or sell them at local trade shows or craft fairs give them away for gifts we've done that a lot we've gone out and harvested at the end of the season everything we could before the first first Frost and dried them and made all sorts of holiday gifts with them but if you can't do that you're going to end up composting them it's just kind of the nature of the way it goes you end up with more green matter than you can then you can take care of or find a market for so being creative and finding those new markets for leftovers in the field is really important and being creative you may be like us growing and selling culinary herbs or cooking herbs but you might just find yourself at the end of the season or the middle of the Season making some potpourri or making some other products so that you are using what you're growing to the best Advantage for you and your business when you're looking at season long sales you might find that it's not profitable to begin your sales until your biggest seller is ready and I'll give you an example of that with Garden dwellers Farm our biggest seller is basil and although as I mentioned I have stage and Thyme and oregano out there that are looking good and you all if you've grown them before you know that those chives are going to be up and looking good in a few weeks here you know so we would have product to sell in a matter of two to three weeks our biggest seller is basil and that will be ready for another month and a half to two months and and so it's just not worth our time and the travel to get to our markets um it's not profitable for us to begin our sales for the year or for this season until our biggest seller is ready so you want to capitalize on the season of the year that works out best for your production methods and your crops you can also use your herbs as an ad on sale to other products or someone else's and it's a great way to increase your profits when we were selling at farmers markets we love uh being next to the the big produce vendor next to us because we would talk to them and say okay what's coming into season next week and they say oh next week is going to be the first week for broccoli so you can bet but that next week we would have a recipe along with us for broccoli and some herb or you know we'd have a recipe for corn and corn and tarragon when that came into season and always playing off of what else is in the market can increase your sales another way to do that would be if you are maybe growing and selling [Music] um home decorations like swags and wreaths and things like that many herbs have dual uses you might only be doing the the home craft or home decorations but Anna's hiccup is also a great tea herb and maybe your neighbor or someone else at the market is is selling dried tea mixtures and you can work with them to sell them your product that they could make into theirs or maybe there's somebody that's making soap and and they want mint in their silk so work with others around you for those add-on sales or those additional sales that you can use your product in more ways than maybe what you're just focusing on so um if that's your goal remember to focus on only those that are are well known easy to grow and easy to sell it's difficult sometimes with herbs that are going to give you trouble to to get them to grow and make them extremely marketable I do want to say a little bit about medicinal herbs I getting away from medicinal herbs most medicinal herbs have not had clinical trials and you use all herbs at your own risk some herbs can have adverse reactions with other medications standardized doses have not been set for herbs and so you're never sure if you are taking too much or too little the potency of herbs can vary greatly depending upon the growing conditions and the environment these are some of the reasons that I personally have kind of stayed away from the medicinal herb Market I really encourage you to have a great level of knowledge in education if you're going into that area however there are a few herbs that have been scientifically proven to to be of health benefit echinacea is one it goes to the immune system garlic is good for the heart and cholesterol ginseng is also good for the heart St John's Wort Ginkgo and parsley Believe It or Not which contains very high levels of iron they've all been proven to be a benefit to your health so I I encourage you if you are going into the medicinal herb area to have a great amount of Education a great amount of knowledge do your scientific research um and be very careful about any claims you might make we don't want to be out there um making false claims with anything that we're selling and when we're talking about the culinary herbs the cooking herbs we know from TV and magazines and and all of the media around us that cooking at home and being more adventurous in your cooking is really grown in popularity lately people are are maybe doing a bit more home cooking than they used to and and they're getting more adventurous so they're trying new herbs and new things on the left hand side I have a list of of the common culinary herbs basil Sage thyme rosemary garlic or chives Savory parsley oregano margarine and cilantro which of course goes well with almost any tomato based dish on the right hand side are maybe those that are not quite as common um but they are still they have great value in The Culinary World fennel as I mentioned we use the the leaf instead of a bulb lemon balm or lemon gravina is not only good with chicken and fish it's also great in teas and as hiccups cakes and candies and also tea Stevia um that's come on the market and gotten very popular within the last oh seven eight years um it's on the market it has Truvia the natural sweetener and you'll see a lot of stevia's that can be grown from seed and actually does quite well here in North Dakota as an annual calendula is often thought of as a flower in your flower beds very easy to grow but the petals are great we have some wonderful recipes for cookies and and baked goods with the calendula and the petals add wonderful colors to salads nasturtiums if you've never eaten an assertion again which is thought of as a flower in your flower bed but if you've never eaten the leaves or the flowers themselves I really encourage you to try them they have a wonderful peppery flavor to them um that that adds just so much to a fresh salad not only the color of the flowers but also the leaves themselves celery act if you like celery boy you can add celery act to just about anything same with lovage it has that kind of celery sort of flavor mint any any of the mints of course and then tarragon those would be some but that are a little bit more Uncommon and might not if you were selling themselves quite as well as the list on the left hand side but certainly would be easy to grow offerings that you could have as part of your sales so a little bit more about some of those easy to grow ones basil it is an annual it grows from seed some people buy basil plants I honestly don't see the need to do that basil seed is very inexpensive and it grows really fast you do want to make sure that you have a ground temperature of 55 degrees or more but if your ground is nice and warm and you put that seed in you'll see some seedlings popping through within two to three days that's how fast it is and so that's why I guess I've never seen the need to purchase basil plants it is an annual and it is very Frost sensitive so you want to make sure all danger of frost is passed in the spring and that you do everything you can do with it before the first Frost in the fall time most times are perennial here at Garden dwellers Farm I like to plant a variety called German winter time during the winter time has proven itself to be not only the most flavorful of the varieties but also the most reliably hearty you know Winters so I like that kind there's lots of different kinds of time out there though everything's from creeping to woolly time to to other taller white blooming varieties stage it's also a perennial but I do have a question mark there because I have in extreme Winters with no um snow cover I have lost sage plants and they tend to only get three years uh yeah around three years out of a stand of sage so I kind of plan every third year as a new planting of sage so even though it does make it through the winter most years for me um you know I I do plan every couple of years to rejuvenate that bed just to be sure I have it on hand winter savory is one that it's not very common in cooking you will see just the word Savory uh different recipes will just call for Savory there are two kinds of savory there's summer Savory and winter savory the winter savory is listed at the half hearty perennial but my winter savory comes through every year I mean it's just for me at least has been hearty as heck and shows up all the time um I see we had a question about in your comments about replacing this age every couple years is that in your high Towers my high tunnels are outside that's outside the only thing we put in our high tunnel is uh basil because it likes it warm and that's one way we can get a jump on the season is to put the basil in the high tunnel and I will also put some about half of the Rosemary I grow in there um only because my Rosemary plugs come in so early in the season that I just don't have a lot of room in the house for them so I end up putting about half of them out into the high tunnel um that's the only thing we grow in there the rest of our herbs we put out in the field so they're they're out in the field so the winter savory to go back to that is a really well behaved uh plant a nice sturdy stocks um it's a hearty for me reliably hearty for me has a good peppery flavor to it great whenever a recipe calls for Savory um it's very tidy it stays in a nice round ball and it doesn't Runner all over and and very well behaved in in my garden and my production laws Giants of course also perennial and you can also get garlic chives they grow very fast very early very reliably Hardy parsley is truly a biennial which means that the first year is going to put out a lot of greens and the second year it's going to try and go to flower or seed in our area we grow it as an annual in other words we till it under at the end of that first year because in my experience when it comes back that next year you're not going to get a lot of leaf off of it it's going to try and go to seed right away now if you're seed savings you may want to keep some of those around that second year to collect that seed if you your goal is the leaves themselves treat it as an annual and grow it from seed my parsley seed I put out as early as I can in fact as soon as my production lot out there the snow is gone and the soil is dry enough to work I put the parsley seed out there even if I know it's going to frost several more times I still go ahead and plant because parsley can take a frost and and not have any issues with that and so by planting it really early like that that's one less thing I have to think about planting later on parsley also takes up to 20 21 days to come up from feed so it's going to take its darn sweet time so I I get that in as early as possible I talked about the winter savory the summer Savory is an annual in comparison to its winter savory cousin which is a perennial so an annual you would as an annual you would want to seed it every year and that I also grow from seed oh that one's not quite as pretty it tends to fall over in the wind it doesn't have quite as strong as stems and it does have a bit of a different flavor from the winter savory but it still has that has a very good flavor and is still very good for cooking and the last uh one on this slide is lemon balm it's a relative of the mint family um I have found it again to be kind of half hearty perennial some years it comes back really good for me and other years it doesn't kind of depends on how much snow we've had how cold it got um the good thing about lemon balm is it does grow really easy from seed so if you have some seed packets or a seed packet that you can pick up for lemon balm it really you can replace it quite quickly if you were counting on it to come back over the winter and it didn't some of the culinary herbs that are more of a challenge are Rosemary I've mentioned Rosemary several times already and I've mentioned that I I get in clubs or little plants they're little rooted cuttings is what they are Rosemary is not Hardy in North Dakota and so you need to either bring your plants inside if you have them in a container or if you're growing them on a larger scale you need to replant them every year you can purchase Rosemary seed and it's not that hard to get it to germinate to come up but after it germinates it just seems to languish and sit there and I haven't had really good luck out of all the years I've tried um to get it to push past that initial germination point to really end up with a good looking rosemary plant so um I just go ahead and order limited cuttings another way that you could do that would be if you had a place to to overwinter in your home or or a greenhouse a large Rosemary mother plant you could take cuttings because they do root quite easily from cuttings Lavender is another one that I know we've all seen in our seed catalogs those beautiful pictures of the rows of lavender and oh how pretty it is lavender really is not fully hearty in our area I know Sage burden herbs up in Manitoba they'll tell you they can get their their lavender to overwinter just fine um they really know some secrets and some tricks because I've never been able to get the lavender to to reliably over winter I'll put in a row of 50 foot roll and maybe 10 plants will come back and that's all so it's not really reliable however that said there are some varieties out there that you can purchase seed for that we can treat as an annual one such variety the variety name is Lady and you can grow that from seed and get it to bloom quite well in one season it's going to be later in the season before it blooms but if you're looking for those blossoms to use in potpourried or in soap so that sort of thing and you're counting on them to be ready in the fall you should be able to manage that we've all seen or heard of using bay leaves in cooking that needs to be a house plant it is a a tree or shrub-like bush it needs to be started from cuttings so you know if you want to have some bay leaves around you can treat that as a house plant in the winter move it outside in the summer and you can have bay leaves which is kind of cool fennel I've talked about that several times you know we don't do the bulbs there are some folks in North Dakota especially the southern part Bismarck Mandan Jamestown Fargo that can get some fairly decent sized fennel bulbs in one season but up here in the North Country Bottineau rugby up in our area it's just really difficult to get any bulb of any size but the fennel leaves are awesome tasting um and if you're not going for that crunch of the bulb you're just going for the flavor that always is pretty easy to grow oregano and marjoram they are very closely related plants that's why you'll see both of them quite often in in Italian cooking or in cooking that has maybe a tomato base to it they both grow really well here my one caution and this is why they're on this slide as being more of a challenge is because they are so closely related and there are so many varieties it's difficult to find a good culinary variety an example of that is I grow two kinds I grow Greek original and I grow Italian oregano and I had always sourced my Italian oregano from one place and one year I thought you know I'm ordering Rosemary plugs from this other Greenhouse maybe I'll just go ahead and order the Italian oregano at the same time from the same place and I got it in and even though they called it Italian oregano it was not the same variety it was not exactly the same plant and that that 280 plants of Italian oregano that I was looking forward to ended up being more like the Greek oregano and just really didn't have the flavor I was looking for so you really have to know what you're ordering paste it if you can see it smell it and be very familiar with what you want before you order it because there's lots of varieties out there that are not the best flavor lemon balm as I mentioned may not overwinter and then tarragon only being a challenge because it's hearty here it's a perennial it grows quite large it'll take off and just be crazy all summer long and that is probably the challenge is that it can get quite large but it can sucker or Runner itself out and not be the nicest guest in your garden um and so it's it's a little bit more of a challenge only in that way it grows like crazy and it is a perennial um you want the French tears on for cooking that's the kind there's Russian and there's french you want the French but it it is quite um prolific so harvesting storing and using your herbs you can dry them I recommend drying them in a in an oven if you do it that way you want them to be at 100 degrees or lower um as low as it will go until they're very crispy some people if they have a gas oven they will not turn the oven on at all they'll just use the ambient heat of the pilot light in the oven it takes longer of course to do it that way and you don't want to forget that they're in there when you go to make supper that night but the lower temperature that you can dry them at the less chance you will have of cooking them instead of drying them because the purpose is to remove that moisture that water out of the plant without removing those oils that give it its good flavor so the lower temperature you can go the better an alternative way to to store them or to preserve them is to hang dry them very easy simply just um you know Bunch them together in in small bunches not too big a bunches and with a a clip or a rubber band and hang them in a warm dark place Out of the Dust until they're dry now if you live in the country or on a gravel world like I do and you say now that's great but we're really dusty around here you can put a paper bag over them to kind of keep the dust off which is a nice way to do that as well excuse me um you can freeze them and this happens to be one of my favorite ways to do this because it's quicker to me it seems easier when I freeze my herbs I rough chop them so in other words they're bigger pieces not teeny tiny pieces put them in an ice cube tray fill the ice cube tray up with water or butter or oil depending on how you're going to use them later and I put them in the freezer and once they're frozen I pop them out of that ice cube tray I put them in a freezer bag an appropriate Ziploc freezer bag and label them because once they're in ice cube steak they all kind of look alike green little cubes so make sure that you label them with what they are and pop them back in the freezer the interesting or the nice thing about doing it this way is an ice cube tray once you've added some water it's pretty much equivalent to like a tablespoon depending on your ice cube tray a tablespoon or two tablespoons which is just about right for a lot of your recipes so it comes up being really convenient in the end um if you're going to dry them whether you dry them in the oven or you're hang dry them when you are storing them you want to keep them as low or as whole as possible until you use them when you start to crush them up and crumble them up you are you're releasing those oils and again that's what gives it its flavor and I thought it was interesting because within the last several months um the the very well-known and large seasoning manufacturer McCormick has started that that Trend now they've really started that marketing push to say you know we're putting everything we have in Grinders now because the more whole it is the better it is Suzanne has asked a question about dehydrators dehydrators are great again you want to make sure your dehydrating hydrating them at a low temperature 100 degrees or under and and then dehydrators yes of course work wonderfully herbal teas are really uh they're good for you they are low in calorie higher in nutrients and they just taste darn good some of the common herbs or teas or drinks are of course the mint the hiccups if you're not familiar with yourself it has kind of a licorice flavor so if you like licorice um you might want to consider some of the hiccups I particularly like anise Jacob which has a beautiful purple flower and works well as a substitute for lavender Bergamot or bee balm Lemon Verbena lemon balm chamomile and lemon basil are all wonderful in herbal teas lavender or Hound Beaver Pew Angelica sweet grass or lemongrass and rose hips are all common herbs that you can grow we don't often think of roses as an herb but they are um the hips of course are actually seeds not the third part of the plant but they fall into that herb category lemongrass or sweet grass is one that you will want to have in a pot so you can take it in the house because to get the good base or bulbous end of the plant um which is what's best for tea you will want to have a very long season or or keep them as a houseplant this is a picture of annasop I mentioned that it works really well as alternative to Lavender and you can kind of see that in this picture this is a bunch that I had harvested for some tea way back in 2004 they use we looked at that beautiful purple color isn't that gorgeous it also looks really good in the flower bed can you imagine how beautiful that would look next to other colorful flowers yellows oranges it really is a standout in the garden it tends to be for the most part perennial again like lemon balm if if we have one of those really bad Winters you may lose it but it grows really well from seed and for most cases will be perennial for you but it's about two and a half feet tall and is really pretty in my opinion what is what a nice addition to either of the flower garden herb garden Olive vegetable garden when you're making herbal tea we do not recommend sun tea because leaving things out what a great way to grow bacteria let's take some moisture and put it in the sun where it's warm and and leave it there so I don't recommend something the best way to gather is gather your herbs put them in a cheesecloth bag or a tea holder boil your water separate and then pour the water over the tea leaves don't put them all together then you're going to let it steep for three to five minutes depending on what you like to taste and then enjoy one note here though currently in North Dakota is not allowed by the State Health Department or any of the local Health districts to actually sell the beverage tea at farmers markets or other markets however you could make the tea bags with the dried tea and sell those of course you can make all sorts of Home Cosmetics bath disease that's soaking soaking bags lotions soap massage and Body Oil um all of those things can be made very easily with your herbs and the recipes are all over the Internet so you know it's not something I'm going to spend time going into here um but but that's a potential Outlet or a potential market for herbs that you could be growing at home herbs just for the aroma Sweet Annie is a type of Artemisia that grows very tall five to six feet tall has a beautiful golden color in the fall and it makes great wreaths and swags and decorations um lavender as I mentioned we talked about that heliotrope has a very vanilla scent and there's another purple flower you can find that in your local nurseries and garden centers Bergamot is a is also bee balm and is wild around here Artemisia or wormwood and I see we have Michelle has asked any of these herbs repel insects like box elder bugs now the Sweet Annie and the wormwoods have been said to repel insects and in fact I used to sell a fair amount of the Sweet Annie and wormwood in Reeves when we were in Minnesota um to people that had cabins because they would put them in their cabins to keep kind of the the spiders and the bugs out over winter um the Patchouli that's listed on this slide Lemon Verbena and rosemary all kind of have that same um insecticidal properties to them but you know I'll be real honest and say you know some people say basil oil does the same thing repels flies I will sit in my high tunnel surrounded by thousands of basil plants and be covered with insects so you know I think it uh there's room for improvement on any of these but if I had to recommend trying any of these for repelling insects it would be the Sweet Annie and any of the artemisions and the patchouli and maybe they're Rosemary uses for aromatic herbs stewing herbs if you're not familiar with storing herbs that they used to when they had dirt floors they would they would put the herbs down on the floor and walk on them to make it smell good in the house of course potpourri wet or dry sachets for your closets and and in amongst your Linens and your towels and of course I've mentioned wreaths and swags many times some herbs to think about winter savory chives still basil Sage Bergamot lemon balm thyme Anna take up and the mint when you can contain them because they will get away from you they like to crawl and be friendly with other places um but those are kind of my favorites and if I had to choose what to start with that would be my list of where to start my least liked herbs comfrey chicory oregano only because it's like I mentioned it's tough to get a good tasting one um mints when they're not contained when you can't keep them where they belong they're not my favorite some are Savory I mentioned it's just not pretty it's it kind of Falls over in the winds and the cilantro only because it's a challenge to keep cilantro from bolting In the Heat of the summer and here's the cilantro I know we're running out of time but I just want to take a couple of minutes to talk about um the cilantro to do it well you need to plant cilantro in succession here at the farm we plant cilantro every two weeks and it only gets six inches tall and we're cutting it and it only lasts two to three weeks and then we take that whole room out because once it gets hot once we start getting into the heated summer the first thing it's going to want to do is form flowers and seeds and that's not what you're planning it for you're planning it for that wonderful aromatic Leaf to use in that summer salsa with those home grown tomatoes um so my suggestion people ask me very often how do I grow good cilantro my six suggestion is to just keep planting it every two to three weeks Deb says that her cilantro gets bugs now honestly I have never had my cilantro get bugs if if you happen to know what kind of bug it gets please let me know because then I could probably give you a suggestion on what to do about that um but I've never had that issue so I'm I'm not sure what kind of bug would be bothering it although it is kind of in the same family as the parsleys and some of the monarch butterfly caterpillars may like it here's just kind of a list of things that we grow I've talked about all of these throughout the presentation in in different forms um just giving you a lift to maybe kind of uh spark your interest in growing something new or something different or going down an Avenue for add-on sales or for sales for your home agricultural business when harvesting as I mentioned avoid the heat of the day you want to cool down the herbs as quickly as possible high humidity is the key to Fresh long lasting herbs you do not want them wet just in kind of a humid environment most herbs will regrow for a second cutting within two weeks so plan to plant twice what you need if you're cutting every week if you're taking them to the farmers market every week and you think okay I'm going to cut uh 20 feet of cilantro every week to take to the market then you're going to want to plant 40 feet make sure you use clean utensils to help prevent the spread of disease here is what it looks like when we are harvesting our basil um you know it's kind of backbreaking work you're down on your hands and knees I I have a little stool that I use quite often to sit on and go down the row and cut we cut each piece each tip by hand with the basil and then they get dunked in this cooler this cooler is full of fairly cold water we don't want it ice cold but but you want cool water what you are trying to do is shock those stoma into closing first of all and second of all you're you're taking the field heat out of those herbs so that it starts that cooling process um and then you want to get them we put them in plastic tubs or totes uh like you can see there we put the lid on and we put them in a cool dark place the plastic totes with the lid on will hold the humidity in and that's what I was saying is you want them humid but not wet packaging at a farmer's market how you display and package your herbs that the market really depends on your Market customer preferences we like large tubs with lids because we again can keep the humidity up um but if you're going to package them because that's what the customers at your market like make sure that you package them in a breathable package and packages closely to sale time as possible because again water is the enemy if you're packaging to wholesale uh to restaurants or institutions most of them will take them by the pound or an increments of a pound half pound quarter pound and we'll take them in in just a plain bag a plain clear bag make sure that you are using um bags that are specifically for food and that's what they're intended for food grade bags are good vented ones ones with holes in or or a way for air exchange is our best and purchase the bag that fits the most usual quantity you are selling it's what you sell the most of is a pound then purchase bags that uh that will hold a pound and I say this because again as a business you don't want to spend a whole lot of money buying up a bunch of inventory such as four different sizes of bags when really you only need one size a bag to make do for most of your customers it's going to save your business money and inventory um packaging to retail stores such as grocery stores is a little bit trickier you want to visit with them and talk to them about their expectations if you were in a grocery store and you think you want to sell herbs to them take a look at what they have some grocery stores just have their herbs packaged in a clear plastic bag with a very simple label on it others have them bunched in bunches that are tied with rubber bands or twist ties and others have them in soy or plastic based clam shells what we call clam shells the best thing you can do is to look at at their packaging and mimic things that as closely as possible some stores may require you to have a UPC label or a PLU which is a product lookup packaging can be your most expensive cost in herb sale right after transportation and distribution and finding labels and packaging materials can be really difficult if you're interested if and you intend on packaging your product be careful to have the equipment or facilities necessary to store it before delivery and when I say that what I mean is you know some you put one ounce of herbs in packages they're going to take up a whole lot more room then if they were in the tubs like I showed earlier this is a picture of our product on the grocery store itself you can see that we do use the plastic clam shells and I will tell you and we have a UPC label you can see that down in the lower right and I can tell you that the packaging and the labeling of our product is the the part of our product that takes the most time and costs us the most money and so if you really want to do your homework lay out your business plan before you go down that road but it can be very enjoyable growing organic remember not to use phrase or chemicals on food products if you can avoid it if you do need to do that be sure you're following all of the label and manufacturer instructions manure is a wonderful soil conditioner as well as fertilizer when applied appropriately so be sure that you understand the food safety rules for applying soil amendments and most herbs are relatively disease and bug free I can honestly tell you other than grasshoppers I've never really had an issue with bugs on our herbs at all I know I've done a little bit over the time for questions asking but certainly uh would be available here's our website phone number um and our Facebook page if you wish to ask me any questions now or you don't feel you have time and would like to come and visit us at our website or our Facebook page and ask questions later please feel free to do that thank you so much Holly that was a very interesting and I'm sure everyone enjoyed it we have time for a couple questions you can go ahead and type your question in the box if you are interested and I'll I'll put the slide back in case you want to write down Holly's email here we have a question for you how well do cold frames work around here they're in Mandan I love cold frames they work really well especially for those things that are um kind of cold tolerant to begin with the dill cilantro fennel um all parsleys of all of those things are are fairly cold tolerant to begin with as well as many of The Perennial ones if they're also a great way to get as I mentioned basil likes it warm and while you wouldn't be able to start basaling your Cold Frame now you certainly would be getting a jump on having them planted in the garden by putting them in a Cold Frame you could get at least two to three weeks jump on them that way next question was how well does Stevia grow for me Stevia grows really well for me I the stevia seed is a little bit expensive but it's come down a lot in the last couple years I always start mine from C I put it out uh in the field and it just it grows like crazy I mean it gets uh well 20 to 22 inches tall and if you pinch it when it's young so that you are encouraging it to Branch you can get more branches which of course means more leaves off of it um and I've really never had any disease or insect issues with the stevia at all I've really had good luck with it so I will bring our session to a close even though I think we could go on all afternoon thank you again to everybody for attending today please fill out the survey that you'll get the link to and join us again next week you'll hear all about spotted windrosophila so there you go",
