probably a small cup load she's not used

121
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,269
to getting milked and I'm not used to

122
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,680
milking so and they're new here so I

123
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,959
don't know if it's right but I'm trying

124
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,110
to ease her into it though getting her

125
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:50,559
too upset and the kids upset that's my

126
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,540
