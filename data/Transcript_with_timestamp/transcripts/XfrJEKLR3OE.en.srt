in mozambique 80 percent of people

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,519
depend on agriculture and food

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,320
fish meat and vegetables are part of the

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,880
culture but fisheries decline in recent

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,880
years have led to fish scarcity and

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,199
increase of prices

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,279
also poor production techniques and high

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,560
costs of farming have made fish a

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,960
delicacy that few can afford many people

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,040
rely on starchy foods and vegetables

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,040
leading to unbalanced diets that lack

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,040
protein

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,120
recent cyclones devastated the country

destroying lives and livelihoods and

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,160
creating new challenges for food

maintaining fragile food systems

foundation to rebuild the agricultural

food systems in the province of gaza

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,799
placing aquaculture at the core of local

31

transformation fao is promoting

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,280
integrated aquaculture as a way to

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,280
generate fish production and create jobs

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,360
for young people and women that's

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,119
critical for protecting households from

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,280
more climate shocks and building

37
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,200
resilience to global shocks such as

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,840
covid19

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,240
in chilembena fao is providing

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,399
assistance and capacity building on new

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,880
technologies and business skills in an

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,200
integrated project where aquaculture

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,200
agriculture and livestock complement

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,280
each other it's about giving men and

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,600
women new opportunities to generate

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,880
their own production using innovative

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,880
integrated aquaculture solutions

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,280
the project aims to

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,520
restart local food production with an

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,720
integrated system that includes fish

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,720
livestock and crops

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,640
develop fish farming recycle waste and

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,760
save energy while maintaining ecological

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,319
balance build capacity for women and

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,319
youth from local agricultural schools

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,080
despite the challenges imposed by the

57
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,400
covid19 pandemic the project has already

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,400
proven to be a success almost a year

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,080
since it began participants have

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,480
produced 16 tons of fish 2.5 hectares of

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,080
maize and sweet potatoes and bread

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,360
training as well as research and

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,080
development they have learned good

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,640
agricultural practices using good seeds

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,720
and feeds fertilization and irrigation

70
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,720
techniques and the need for markets and

71
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,720
marketing this project gives them

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,519
reasons to believe they can start their

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,040
own business on fish farming chickens

improving nutrition and increasing

resilience to climate change threats and

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,120

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,959
it can only be achieved by building

80
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,959
better and sustainable food systems
