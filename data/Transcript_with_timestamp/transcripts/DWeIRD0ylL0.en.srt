1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,920
nice hey there welcome back to the

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,839
homestead today i'm working on setting

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,639
up our off-grid

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,519
um garden irrigation system

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,040
this is a kit i got online on amazon

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,960
i'll put a link down below there's also

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,480
some extra parts that i got i'll also

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,560
put links for those if you watch the

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,359
tank video there's an irrigation ditch

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,439
up there and it feeds this tank

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,640
and my garden is not much lower than

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,080
this tank

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,199
so i don't have enough pressure with

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,800
gravity to give me my drip system

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,520
the pressure that it needs

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,520
so i got this well pump should do uh

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,320
we'll go over that a little bit later

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,680
and a solar charging system that will

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,559
hopefully give me the pressure that i

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,879
need to do a drip system and basically i

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,280
can just set it and forget it so

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,280
let's get started

23
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,599
nice

24
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,160
so we got the system all set up

25
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,760
we'll go through it real quickly uh

26
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,519
basically what we got here on the front

27
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,160
are we'll start with the structure this

28
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,239
was just an old uh crate that i came on

29
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,000
a project i was working on with a pallet

30
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,599
and uh sides

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,560
so i used one of the sides and i used

32
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,800
the pallet

33
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,720
seemed to work out pretty well

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,519
on that is two

35
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,840
100 watt solar panels for a total of 200

36
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,120
watts

37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,200
just did some bracing here

38
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,800
just hold them up

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,120
and then those holes

40
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,360
are for uh the wires to come through

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,519
let's take a peek inside

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,360
uh the kit that i had gotten came with

43
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,200
the two solar panels

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,680
the charge controller and the solar

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,959
pump or and the well pump

46
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,120
along with assorted wires and all that

47
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,760
so we'll check out this the charger

48
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,120
basically what it does it takes the

49
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,080
solar panel

50
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,239
power and you plug it in here

51
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,360
that charges the battery

52
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,040
and also gives power to the load the

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,200
load in this case is going to be that

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,720
well pump

55
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,840
over here is a timer 12 volt timer

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,120
what that is doing is basically if if i

57
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,439
didn't have the timer the pump would

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,599
just run continuously

59
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,280
until the battery went dead or

60
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,400
we'll go over the setup on this real

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,560
quick

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,720
the white wire here this red and then

63
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,879
there's a black back there that is

64
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,319
feeding the timer it needs a little bit

65
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,319
of power to run

66
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,040
so i'm just robbing some power off the

67
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,280
load side to give that some juice

68
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,720
and then i'm taking the

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,239
positive side this red wire there

70
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,960
and feeding that to the timer

71
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,199
and then off that that white wire there

72
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,280
is running to the pump

73
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,800
and then the

74
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,880
negative

75
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,919
is just this and it just runs all the

76
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,639
way through to the pump so that is the

77
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,199
oh and then the battery is just a marine

78
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,800
grade battery a deep cell nothing too

79
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,800
special just the uh

80
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,680
i think i did group 24

81
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,919
so 70 to 85 amp hours

82
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,919
not really too sure how well it's going

83
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,680
to work but i think it should get us

84
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,639
where we want to be

85
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,440
at this time the sun is

86
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,360
a little cloudy out there

87
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,720
so there's not too much sun out but we

88
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,880
are doing 13.2 volts

89
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,720
the solar panel is charging the battery

90
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,800
and then the load is

91
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,759
operational but right now because the

92
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,080
timer

93
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,240
the pump is not running i just have it

94
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,360
on manually off let's go take a look at

95
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,320
the pump

96
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,759
okay so the way i ran it um through the

97
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,759
hole in the

98
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,000
tank lid

99
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,280
i have a rope the power wire and a half

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,840
inch

101
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,880
drip line hose i pulled the pump out so

102
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,880
that we can have a little look

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,600
it's got a

104
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,000
half inch barbed fitting back there oh i

105
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,000
put a

106
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,120
pipe clamp on there hose clamp i also

107
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,360
put a rope on there so i'm not tugging

108
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,400
on the

109
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,639
fitting there or also the power line

110
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,240
it's a pretty neat little setup

111
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,600
stainless steel they have so many

112
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,160
options of this

113
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,000
i went with this one because it is

114
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,880
a higher gpm

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,160
uh 3.2 gpm

116
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,199
and i wanted that for more

117
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,479
gallons per minute and also pressure

118
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,319
just a quick peek inside the tank

119
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,360
what i got it here

120
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,039
is a

121
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
float valve

122
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,000
basically

123
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,560
once the water comes up to a certain

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,319
level the float floats and turns off the

125
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,280
water

126
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,520
coming from the ditch up there

127
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,560
let's dunk this tank real quick

128
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,880
or the

129
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,880
pump

130
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,080
and we'll fire it up

131
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:49,720
so this has a auto

132
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,720
on and off

133
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,800
might be able to hear it

134
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,919
a little noisy there's some vibration in

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,720
there for sure

136
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,919
i did put a pressure gauge on here

137
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,440
so right now i'm going to turn on the

138
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,800
pressure gauge because now it's run into

139
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,000
the drip system and what happens here

140
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,000
is it has a lot of pressure

141
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,199
boom

142
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,360
so that gauge goes over

143
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,360
to 100 and as you've seen the needle

144
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,520
just went all the way around drip system

145
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,840
that i have here is set up for

146
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,280
10 psi and i wasn't thinking i would

147
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,039
even get as much psi as i'm getting now

148
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,240
but uh yeah this is actually a lot

149
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,360
better than i thought i'm actually gonna

150
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,680
have to get a regulator so yeah

151
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,520
let's go take a look at the drip system

152
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,360
so now i got the drip going and now it

153
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,280
starts to rain what i'm doing here is

154
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,759
i'm gonna do two two separate zones

155
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,639
there's nine beds i'm gonna separate

156
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,080
them into like four and five two lines

157
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,319
running this way

158
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,599
i haven't set these beds up yet

159
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,759
but i really wanted to see how this

160
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,400
thing worked so i did set up

161
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,720
these four beds here

162
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,280
the material that i'm using for the drip

163
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,479
system is known as drip tape

164
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,160
i guess they call it that because it

165
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,720
lays flat

166
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,240
and it has these

167
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,240
little slits right here

168
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,479
so this setup is designed to do

169
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,800
140 gallons

170
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,959
per hour per 100 foot

171
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,800
so these are 50 foot beds each bed has

172
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,640
two lines which means it has a hundred

173
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,560
foot of drip line

174
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,240
and then what happens when it gets

175
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,000
pressure which i think these are over

176
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,760
pressured for sure

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,200
it round it

178
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,120
rounds up like uh normal

179
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,519
uh irrigation tubing what i'm using for

180
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,279
the header is just

181
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,760
typical

182
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,480
black irrigation pipe

183
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
your standard drip irrigation

184
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,160
you know the stuff you get at the home

185
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,760
depot or whatever is capable of doing

186
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,279
much more pressure

187
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,120
i wasn't thinking i was going to have

188
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,399
this much pressure so that's why i went

189
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,640
with this

190
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,279
