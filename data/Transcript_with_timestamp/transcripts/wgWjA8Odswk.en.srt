realize until I was 36 and so I've been

103

begging and begging for chickens for

104
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,639
like pretty much our entire relationship

105
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,000

106
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,919
time or space or the housing or the

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,680

so it's like my favorite part of the

116
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,199
morning so we 2020 hit and my husband

117
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,800
just came home

118
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,600
and I was like yes now's my time for

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,960
chickens he has nowhere to go and we're

120
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,479
stuck here so I'm quite persistent um

121
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,840
with students I really love and that I

122
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:44,199
really know I want and um so he was like

123
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,080
all right let's get a few backyard

124
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,360
chickens but we have to do it right so

125
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,400
you know it was a neighborhood it's not

126
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,880
our forever home we had to make a nicer

127
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,560
Coupe which was you know actually helped

128
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,680
the resale value which was great but um

129
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,479
what we but yeah we got chickens we got

130
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,280
like six okay I li chicken math is real

131
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,240
y'all we got 10 I was like yeah yeah

132
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,400
yeah go to the farm go get some chickens

133
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,880
and bring them home I'm like okay cool

134
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,360
I'm only going to get six that's all we

135
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,080
need and then you see them and they're

136
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,919
there and you're like I need more than

137
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,639
six so

138
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,960
I and he was like what are you doing you

139
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,680
said six and I said what I what if some

140
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,960
die you know I heard that's a thing and

141
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,479
so you know 10 became eventually 20 in a

142
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,639
little backyard where I'm only legally

143
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,360
allowed to have six but like I kind of

144
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,720
paid off my neighbors with eggs so it

145
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,680
worked out it's fine it was fine and so

146
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,199
no absolutely and it was great I wanted

147
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:45,520
chickens originally just for eggs I had

148
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:48,039
no clue the genuine effect it would have

149
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,120
on my mental health um and it funny

150
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,280
thing is it all started with a funny

151
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,840
little bird that my husband named

152
00:06:52,280 --> 00:07:00,160
murderface and she's the one who started

153
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:04,160
it all for me uh she laid me my first

154
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:07,120
blue egg and she was the weirdest friend

155
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,199
I ever had and anytime I felt sad you

156
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,479
know I'm a veteran I've got issues like

157
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,160
every other veteran and um I would go

158
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,080
out there just to be alone and just

159
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,879
listen to my chickens and it was one of

160
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,599
the most therapeutic things for me they

161
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,919
weren't snuggly like a dog they didn't

162
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:23,840
want me to pet them all the time they

163
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,160
just want to be at my feet and pecket

164
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,759
stuff and just be next to me and I'm

165
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,080
like this is nice so yeah I found in

166
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,520
love hard like real hard and I kind of

167
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,199
became a crazy chicken lady to where now

168
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,800
I have this really kickass

169
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,240
Farm I just feel so blessed by it all

170
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,680
the time that's how we got here we my

171
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,199
husband's about to retire and we're like

172
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,080
What do we do and he wanted to go

173
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,319
Contracting and I'm like no please don't

174
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,240
do that I don't think I can handle that

175
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,240
anymore so can you reconsider like why

176
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,319
don't we be farmers and like his initial

177
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,560
reaction you know was like what that's

178
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,400
too easy no way and then I'm like well

179
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,919
just think about it so and then next

180
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,599
thing you know I hear him doing YouTube

181
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,800
videos and he's like yeah let's do this

182
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,319
like all right I'm in I see where you're

183
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,560
going that makes total sense he he saw

184
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,960
the magic on the YouTubes and he was

185
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,599
like right on board with me um from the

186
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,000
beginning and it was just amazing um I I

187
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,879
took a shot in the dark with him I

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,440
thought he'd say no and he surprised me

189
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:37,000
so wonderfully in like the greatest way

190
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,200
and it's I came here I came here out to

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,200
pinland for him as a Green Beret I

192
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,959
didn't want him to retire and completely

193
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,519
lose everything about himself because I

194
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,839
made that mistake when I got out and I

195
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,680
only did six years I left everything

196
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,680
that I knew behind and everyone and it

197
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,040
was not a good thing not at all a good

198
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,800
thing and so I had to figure out what I

199
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,959
had to do the hard way and it was not

200
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,920
kind and after 20 years I couldn't

201
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,640
imagine what that would be like for my

202
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,279
husband and I chose this area for him

203
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,959
mainly because as a Green Beret you know

204
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,839
you need your identity still you can't

205
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,040
just take that away and that's so

206
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,240
ingrained and I felt like you need to be

207
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,760
near your people they're my people too

208
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,079
now so let's go this is a great place

209
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,160
I've already worked out here as a as a g

210
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:28,240
fighter in pin land um that's a gorilla

211
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,240
Fighter um Pine Land is a fictitious

212
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,399
country that closely res resembles North

213
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,440
Carolina and it practice uh they teach

214
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,079
soldiers unconventional warfare in the

215
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,920
Special Forces World and it's really

216
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:44,120
valuable and I get to work so side by

217
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,519
side with some of America's future

218
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,720
finest like we know one uh Benjamin bun

219
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,320

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,200
Forces man and you know and that's

221
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,760
that's such an honorable job and um oh

222
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,760
oh check this

223
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,959

Farm's always on there's never stopping

227
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,440
on the farm so a lot of people come or

228
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,519
like they don't know about Farm Life

229
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,160
they're just like oh well don't you have

230
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,640
like a few minutes and I'm like yeah I

231

got like five and then in those five

232
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,640
minutes something's trying to kill kill

233
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:32,240
something else or the like it's really

234
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,720
awesome when before I came to the farm I

235
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,480
actually had like a really hard time

236
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:40,279
with life before I came here I suffer

237
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,560
from like really bad PTSD and my figh or

238
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,880
flight is always engaged it's all the

239
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,320
time when you live in a city it's not

240
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,320
the best place for someone like me no

241
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,079
I'm always on guard I'm always wondering

242
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,120
what's that what's this it's like it's

243
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,880
quite I can't fix it there's nothing I

244
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,440
can do um but being here on the farm

245
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:07,120
like fit here like I found a place where

246
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:11,279
I belong because my on it's appropriate

247
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,639
here and I feel so calm knowing that

248
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,880
this is a place where that's okay this

249
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,440
is a place where I can let that be free

250
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,920
because something's always trying to get

251
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,639
killed here and something's always

252
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,320
needing some kind of Defending from

253
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,959
something else and if it's something I

254
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,360
can't turn off well then let me use it

255
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:31,600
in a good way in some way and so it's

256
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,399
been really helpful mostly like all like

257
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,079
it's always been super helpful most of

258
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,399
the time there are times where it gets a

259
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,519
little out of hand because it's a real

260
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,040
situation and I'm like oh my God this is

261
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,760
oh lot I wasn't prepared for this what

262
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,760
like my first time coming across

263
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:51,240
something okay yes Hi here's Teddy yeah

264
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,120
so it's really nice to find a place that

265
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,680
I feel like my Brokenness isn't broken

266
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:01,399
it's been really beneficial to a lot of

267
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:05,160
my healing and a lot of things that I

268
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:09,639
didn't know existed until I got here and

269
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:12,600
I left the city and I saw the difference

270
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,680
and how much release of tension because

271
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,519
I was able to actually do what I've been

272
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,320
taught to do but wasn't untrained how

273
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:24,279
not to do anymore so yeah I I this is my

274
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,959
heaven on Earth I do feel like those

275
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,560
places can exist for people you just

276
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:31,000
have to find

277
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,560
yours yeah I love message sending yeah

278
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,399
it's a great message for everyone and I

279
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,240
know that you're always trying to spread

280
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,800
knowledge too and education on you know

281
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,720
like I I had the privilege of actually

282
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,760
hearing the pitch and not everyone who

283
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,279
went to the shower gets to hear these so

284
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,959
I mean like about milk about um the eggs

285
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,519
in general like what sets your eggs

286
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:52,360
apart like what talk talk us through

287
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,800
that piece because it's very

288
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,360
interesting well I think a lot of people

289
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,440
can do what I do I don't feel like I'm

290
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,079
special I will say that I think think

291
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,800
what's the most important that I don't

292
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,839
feel like I truly got to because I I've

293
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,160
never done a pitch I was so nervous I

294
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,839
didn't no I was so you know it's my

295
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,160
first time yeah the message that like I

296
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,240
really wanted to bring out was that our

297
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,880
food issues in America are very real and

298
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,920
they're very scary 2020 woke me up to

299
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,320
that very much and it's just it's a

300
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,120
trend that's happening and it's

301
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,639
happening more frequently bird flu Aven

302
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
flu Oh now the dairy cows have problems

303
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,680
oh the meat there's something wrong with

304
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,240
meat there's a valid argument to the

305
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,079
people who don't want to eat meat

306
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,399
because they think it's bad for you well

307
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,360
yeah the stuff at the grocery store is

308
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,480
bad for you don't eat it you are what

309
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,320
you eat eats if what you're eating is

310
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,639
eating garbage and labade stuff then of

311
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,639
course it's going to cause you problems

312
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,560
they have a valid argument but the

313
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,360
farmers you know when you're a big

314
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,240
business there's only so many farmers

315
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:03,920
that own and run everything my eggs are

316
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,639
regenerative raised they're pasture

317
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,079
raised they're on grass I mean they have

318
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,000
that huge giant field it's actually

319
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,399
double the size it should be by standard

320
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,519
and I feel like it should be bigger but

321
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,160
you know but anybody can do what I do

322
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,880
lots of people all over America are

323
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,399
doing it already but the only difference

324
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,600
that I'm trying to bring with my eggs is

325
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,720
that I want to deliver them myself

326
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,920
directly to the consumer like to the

327
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,920
groc store and say okay here's your eggs

328
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,279
these are fresh these are the freshest

329
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,680
that they can get we will come and

330
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,199
deliver bi-weekly because I want to make

331
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,680
sure my customers have fresh fresh is

332
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:45,079
always better nutrient count is

333
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,639
nutrients is important for your health

334
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:49,600
and the longer an egg sits the less

335
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,759
nutrients dense they are which means the

336
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,880
less benefits that you get in your body

337
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,480
running like every farmer should be a

338
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,000
soil farmer um for instance White Oak

339
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,440
pastures you can look them up online

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,759
they're really amazing they are super

341
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,600
big into this and they're trying to

342
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,800
change the beef industry as well and

343
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,720
they're trying to change the way things

344
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,320
are done everything's monoculture

345
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,040
everything is just one one one but

346
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,440
that's not Mother Nature that's not the

347
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:18,040
what God intended everything's supposed

348
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:21,279
to go together in harmony like live

349
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,279
together so we can mimic that with with

350
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,279
grazing with appropriate grazing I'm not

351
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,480
thinking of the right word here um

352
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,440
rotational grazing Y and it's easily you

353
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,800
can very easily mimic it you can't do it

354
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,920
with machines you no farmers can never

355
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,560
be replaced with machines we are one of

356
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,959
the most valuable Assets in this country

357
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,519
whoever controls the food controls the

358
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:46,560
people and I'm not okay with that yeah I

359
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,360
want I don't I believe there's another

360
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,959
there's so in the industry of eggs eggs

361
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,720
sit and by the time you get your eggs

362
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:56,120
from the grocery store they're like

363
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,000
almost two months old that's old in my

364
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,519
book I wouldn't eat two months old eggs

365
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,759
I mean I do have the grocery I didn't

366
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,720
know any better now no I wouldn't not

367
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,319
one a bit I'd feed it to my animals I'd

368
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,000
feed it back to them to regenerate give

369
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:09,279
them back you know what protein what's

370
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,519
left but I like nothing goes to waste

371
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:15,880
here you know and so I want to model

372
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,040
something different I think we can do

373
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,759
better I know we can do better there's

374
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,880
Farmers All Over America who can do

375
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,720
exactly what we do and regenerate the

376
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,279
world people are talking about pollution

377
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,399
and all this crap and they're blaming on

378
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:30,680
cow farts well you know why don't you

379
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,480
change the soil cuz everything when it

380
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,639
rains all that water evaporates a lot of

381
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,399
it evaporates in that monoculture

382
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,959
situation and like how do you think

383
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,279
that's handling in our environment about

384
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,240
helping a lot yeah if we change the way

385
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,600
we're farming we could change a lot of

386
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,759
things and it's just not natural what

387
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,519
we're doing it's not healthy either Aven

388
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,000
flu happens because of dirty conditions

389
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,120
and then it spreads very quickly because

390
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,560
it's contagious so avoid the dirty we

391
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,720
haven't had one issue with our birds not

392
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,880
one

393
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,240
not one health issue none of them are

394
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,520
vaccinated none of them all of them are

395
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,439
all natural just chicks here you go

396
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,039
byebye go me some eggs we supplement

397
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,640
every once in a while with a little feed

398
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,919
but we try to supplement with more raw

399
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,400
milk than anything but that's only like

400
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:19,079
winter time summertime they're you know

401
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,079
they get raw milk they might get extra

402
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:25,880
eggs that we didn't sell if there are

403
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:29,400
any left over and what we want to do is

404
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,039
we want to do a model similar a lot of

405
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,960
other Farmers that are doing it but we

406
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,640
want to like Empower them a lot of small

407
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,000
farmers don't have a way to get their

408
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,120
name out there yeah they don't like for

409
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,039
instance vital Farms vital Farms is a

410
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,640
really good idea they are a wonderful

411
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:49,240
practice however they've now are gone

412
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,679
big in corporate and so many people

413
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,000
don't want corporate anymore so many

414
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,960
people want their neighbors but their

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
neighbors an hour away and they can't

416
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,400
always drive there but we can we can

417
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,919
deliver and we want to bring other

418
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,480
Farmers to join us but we don't want to

419
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,679
take away your name we don't want to

420
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,240
take away your identity like vital Farms

421
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,799
I think what they do is great but they

422
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,520
slap their name on someone else's hard

423
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,280
work yeah and then they take a

424
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,520
percentage it's like an affiliate

425
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,720
program they take a percentage from them

426
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,840
so the more money they make the more

427
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,280
money they make cool story but why not

428
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,480
just let that family have it and do it

429
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,440
different let them pay the fees or

430
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,320
whatever that needs to be done to fall

431
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,320
under you and under your your guidelines

432
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,240
and such but that's their label at the

433
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,440
grocery store that they can be proud of

434
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,760
that's their family name out there now

435
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,280
in the world and after a certain amount

436
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,600
of time you know and they learn what we

437
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,559
do we want to teach them we want to

438
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,240
empower them we want to we want to bring

439
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,320
them out to the world like we want to

440
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,440
try that we're trying to bring ourselves

441
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,000
out there but we feel like if we have

442
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,799
more we have like an egg Army of small

443
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,960
farmers just like me who want to put

444
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:06,159

445
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,280
let's do it together let's put your name

446
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:12,159
on the front of that box and mine on the

447
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,640
side on a little code let's do it

448
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,120
backwards like complete opposite from

449
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,200
vital Farms like flip it around one it's

450
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,919
their name that's awesome and their ours

451
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,400
is on that tiny little code on the back

452
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:24,919
you want to know more about fin my D

453
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,520
blah blah blah visit this website you

454
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,720
know but that's that family that's their

455
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,000
honor that's their pride their hard work

456
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,200
and they deserve to show it to whoever

457
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,640
they want to show it

458
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,200
to you know as long as they're within

459
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,799
the guidelines and the standards and

460
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,760
they pass the inspections and they do

461
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:45,039
these things why not give America back

462
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,960
the power take it back if we're going to

463
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,600
fight back if people really want to

464
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,760
fight our government back you don't do

465
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,559
it with guns anymore you got to be

466
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,320
smarter than that you got to play their

467
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,440
game how do you control the people you

468
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,280
control the food yep

469
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,520
and I keep hearing that you know Farmers

470
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,240
like they I mean it's good to hear that

471
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,799
they still exist but it sounds like it's

472
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,480
getting to be a smaller and smaller

473
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,840
number of people doing it and of course

474
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,120
like you said Corporation everything

475
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,400
comes down to money power control um

476
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,039
just like yeah so it's a very scary

477
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,960
thing and I mean food is everything food

478
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:22,520
is food is medicine y so it's incredibly

479
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,600
important I think this message is very

480
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,120
important as well so I kind of want with

481
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,400
Warrior Rising like we talked about a

482
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,799
little bit about your background and the

483
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,520
far itself so how did Warrior rising or

484
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,400
was it the academy was it the community

485
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,760
experience what value did you get from

486
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,240
being a part of warrior rising to help

487
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,240
your farm there's a few things I got

488
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,280
from that from that whole experience all

489
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,320
of it good I'll say that first all of it

490
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:52,919
great having that automatic feeling of

491
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,280
like hey welcome we got you come on and

492
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,280
I i' never met any of those people and

493
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,960
every single one of them was so

494
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,840
supportive every every single veteran

495
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,840
like we're all in competition together

496
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,000
but then I was like wait what this isn't

497
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:11,760
oh this is oh I like this one this is a

498
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,640
good one um I love working together even

499
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,760
though like at the end with still a

500
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,360
competition you know that's my style all

501
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,120
day you know it's all great everyone's

502
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,880
there everyone's still a winner everyone

503
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,919
you know you go home with relationships

504
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,240
you go home with knowledge having my

505
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,159
brain stretched in this way has just

506
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,120
been revitalizing I was able to open a

507
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,640
door in my mind into a passion like this

508
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:41,440
has been my passion for a while but the

509
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:44,120
way that this expanded my mind was not

510
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,559
what I expected it was I I purposely

511
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,279
came um with no expectations because I

512
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:52,360
didn't I didn't want to have any and be

513
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,480
let down because that's what happens to

514
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,159
sometimes with people and I chose to

515
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,120
like kind of hide myself from a lot of

516
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,080
it just because I wanted to just I

517
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,799
wanted to be wow and I was I was floored

518
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,960
I was more than wowed girl I was floored

519
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:11,760
yeah so touching for me having such

520
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,279
overwhelming kindness and love just

521
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,360
thrown at me was just wow it floored me

522
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:20,159
I went there for eggs and I came home

523
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,799
with just the money yeah the money's

524
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,360
great I am not that's amazing but like

525
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,120
if I had to do it all over again and I

526
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,360
didn't get any money I would feel

527
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,200
exactly the

528
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:34,960
same um the people I met the things I

529
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:39,520
learned oh wow the things I learned

530
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:42,240
wow um yeah it was just I'm

531
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,000
Lord I highly yeah it was a very unique

532
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,640
group yeah that that group was so

533
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,840
collaborative so um and that was my

534
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,240
first business shower as a part of the

535
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,960
warrior Rising team and I was absolutely

536
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,760
just overwhelmed in a good way with how

537
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,679
kind everyone was to each other and how

538
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,159
the competition was more supportive I

539
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,159
mean everyone wanted to see the other

540
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,039
person win and wanted to know more about

541
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:06,919
that the industries were so diverse too

542
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:11,000
you didn't see two of the same things

543
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:12,880
there so it was really incredible so um

544
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,799
I know you got to get back to your farm

545
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,240
but if there is a small farmer out there

546
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,120
listening right now or someone who's

547
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,720
into agriculture what would your advice

548
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,400
be for them to start or to to stay the

549
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,159
course when things get hard well for one

550
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:33,320
to get started um research do all the

551
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:37,799
research you can before you jump in have

552
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:40,159
an idea of at least one thing I will say

553
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:43,640
when you get on a farm and you're like

554
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,840
Yay you want to do all the things I'm G

555
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,760
tell you don't do it hump your brakes

556
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,039
hump your brakes my friend don't do it

557
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,320
start with one get real good at that one

558
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:57,600
before you move to the next one because

559
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,520
it will very quickly overwhelm you it it

560
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,720
will it will catch upop with you real

561
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,720
quick we towed that line when we first

562
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,400
got here but that was because we didn't

563
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,720
you know when you get livestock like

564
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,279
goats you have to have more than one and

565
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,159
so they're quite chaotic little

566
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,799
troublemakers so we came here with a

567
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,799
plan we knew we wanted to come for a

568
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:18,279
business we knew also knew we wanted to

569
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:20,440
come for like our forever home and so we

570
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:22,760
were very strategic our forever had to

571
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,440
have job opportunities just in case our

572
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,039
Five-Year Plan didn't work because in in

573
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,159
any true business you have to have a

574
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,480
five-year plan if by you're five if

575
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,679
you're not successful you should

576
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,240
probably throw in the towel you know and

577
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,240
choose something else because you're

578
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,720
just going to be throwing money into a

579
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,840
bucket that has a hole and so with the H

580
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,880
of warrior Rising like we are oh wow

581
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,360
we're we're really getting that that

582
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,320
like we were on our way but it's it's

583
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,880
going to move a little bit faster now

584
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,880
and our dream's going to come a little

585
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,399
faster now and when you choose your land

586
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,799
Choose Wisely don't choose cheaply wise

587
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:03,320
is always better know your area no flood

588
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:05,799
zones planning is super important before

589
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,000
you jump in yeah that's my biggest key

590
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:10,279
advice if you're married and you're

591
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,440
going to do a business together you know

592
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:13,640
you should you should get a little

593
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,480
counseling before you do that depending

594
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,880
on your relationship because it'll test

595
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,399
you it's basically like having a baby

596
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,559
only like magnified times 12 because

597
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:24,120
it's extra work you have to rely on each

598
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,679
other it will either make you or break

599
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,919
you and I feel like it's making us which

600
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,520
is really awesome awesome yeah because

601
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,880
SF life was hard and it was breaking us

602
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,200
but the farm is remaking us and it is

603
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,039
probably one of the most beautiful

604
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,960
gardens I've ever witnessed to start

605
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:44,679
growing in my life after the Army every

606
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,799
single one of the people in my family

607
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:52,360
has found some kind of Freedom here and

608
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:54,559
some kind of peace and it's really

609
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,440
kickass that's incredible I love hearing

610
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,000
that for you and your and your husband

611
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,840
so last piece of advice now

612
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
veterans trying to start their own

613
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,520
business veterans wanting to be

614
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,880
entrepreneurs what is your piece of

615
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,520
advice to them this is not my quote this

616
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,080
actually comes from of another farmer

617
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,760
