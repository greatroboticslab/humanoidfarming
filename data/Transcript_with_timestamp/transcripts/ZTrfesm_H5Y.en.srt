1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,560
water is an important resource for

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,320
everyone and every living thing access

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,360
to clean water for domestic and

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,160
agricultural needs can be difficult for

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,199
many of us especially if electricity is

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,199
not available the intent of this video

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,400
is to demonstrate one way to access

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,199
clean water using local materials tools

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,920
and

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,920
skills this is a rope pump it has been

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,240
around for centuries but with modern

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,200
readily available lowcost materials like

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,840
PVC pip pipe and poly rope its use is

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,680
making a difference in communities

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,160
around the world with this pump water is

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,960
pulled up from a 20ft deep handd dug

17
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,399
well at about 8 to 10 gallons per minute

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,360
by circulating a rope with Tire Pistons

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,800
down the well and back up through the

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,480
PVC pipe this lowcost rope pump has been

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,960
designed to be constructed operated and

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,600
maintained by the local user Community

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,280
with no outside

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,399
funding for domestic use daily water

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,440
needs are n in just a few minutes

26
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,200
through a protected well casing to keep

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,640
the water source

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,520
clean the pump can be driven by your

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,520
arms or legs with one or two

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,640
people for expanded agricultural needs

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,119
the pump and distribution system can be

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,600
easily relocated between several Wells

33
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,240
to maximize

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,159
productivity for agricultural uses the

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,560
leg Drive is the preferred

36
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,119
method this pump is hooked up to a 3 row

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,200
water distribution system made from wood

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,079
and painted fabric it is also hooked up

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,119
to a locally produced sewn visqueen drip

40
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,079
irrigation system that dramatically

41
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,079
reduces the water

42
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,600
needs here are some detail views of the

43
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,600
construction and components

44
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:03,119
needed the tools needed are Handa hand

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,960
drilling bits knife and wrenches power

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,479
tools can be used if

47
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,239
available the hole saw can be locally

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,280
made from any steel pipe this one is

49
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,280
made from a bicycle

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,760
frame the wood bearings are waxed for

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,319
smooth maintenance-free operation in

52
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,319
this wet

53
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,680
environment glass bottles are used to

54
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,840
reduce friction on the Rope at the top

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,840
and bottom of the pump

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,959
the Pistons are made from the used tire

57
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,159
sidewall the double piston Arrangement

58
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,159
is used to increase efficiency and

59
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:46,040
extend rope life the locally available

60
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:50,000
materials you will need are wood one

61
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:54,760
used car tire rope PVC pipe two glass

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
bottles wire wax nails and

63
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:01,840
bolts the 20-ft well was hand dug

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,840
encased with the wood used for short

65
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,080
Bing with a pump and water distribution

66
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,319
system like this you can access clean

67
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,959
water for both domestic and agricultural

68
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,440
needs with the pride and security that

69
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,400
comes with building it

70
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:21,120
yourself one side benefit is

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,440
exercise thanks to all who collaborated

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,400
to make this

73
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,080
