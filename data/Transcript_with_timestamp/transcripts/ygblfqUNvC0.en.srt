1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Our next speaker is uh Jenny Ller from

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,759
Penn State.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay. Thank you, Joe. Um my topic today

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,000
is on sustainable dairy cropping systems

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,519
and we call this the virtual dairy farm

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,240
and you'll see that in a few minutes why

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,080
it's called that. Um I just want to um

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,400
recognize Heather Karsten who's a

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,880
professor at Penn State who is leading

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,920
this project which was funded through um

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,080
Northeast S. Uh Glennon Malcolm is the

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,119
postoc who handles the day-to-day

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,600
activities of this project and Tim Beck

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,280
is a uh farm management educator that we

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,040
work with and Jill was talking this

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,120
morning about you wanted more economic

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,760
information. So I'll be giving you some

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,640
economics here.

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,239
um this project um is very

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,600
interdisciplinary

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,719
and there must be 25 plus faculty and

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,079
staff that are on this project and that

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,360
doesn't include all the graduate

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,840
students. Um so so this is a huge

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,840
project and um we're looking at

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
developing sustainable dairy cropping

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,640
systems and monitoring multiple

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,320
indicators of systems performance. And I

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,280
just have some pictures down here below

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,600
that we're looking at uh red clover as a

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,400
green manure. We've got cover crops.

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,720
We've got um integrated pest management.

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,799
We've got alalfa. So there's a whole lot

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,200
to this project that we're just touching

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,960
the tip of the iceberg. Um, but what I'm

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,280
presenting on today is that we're

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,000
comparing two very diverse cropping

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,640
approaches. And what I'm looking at is

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,320
the impact on feed inventory, feed

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,840
quality, and economics.

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,680
And so what I'm going to be presenting

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,079
today is we're going to be comparing two

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,320
scenarios. Um, so the one I'm going to

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,479
be referring to is the best um,

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,320
management practice, but then we also

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,840
have a best management practice

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,079
enhanced. So the best management and

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,479
best management enhance they both have

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,640
similar practices which is cover and

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,759
green manure crops.

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,240
They both have alalfa and alalfa orchard

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,159
grass mix has integrated pest

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,319
management. And one thing that's very

54
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,280
novel for us in Pennsylvania is we're

55
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:16,000
growing canola for both the feed and the

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,840
fuel. Now in the enhanced um practice

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,360
we're also incorporating small grains

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,480
for silage. We are only growing alalfa

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,160
and an or orchard grass mix. In this

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,160
particular scenario, we are using

61
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,520
reduced herbicide where in the other

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,920
practice we're using standard herbicide

63
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,800
and in the enhanced we're using manure

64
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,800
injection versus in the um just the

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,519
regular best management we're doing um

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,080
surface or broadcast um application of

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,160
manure. And so that's how I'm going to

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,440
be identifying the two practices here as

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,920
we look at some of the comparisons.

70
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,040
Uh this is a picture of our aronomy farm

71
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,360
at Penn State and the goal is here to

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,920
produce the forage feed and fuel for a

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,760
65 lactating cow. And I know probably

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,360
out in this area that's seems pretty

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,720
small but in Pennsylvania the average

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,239
herd size is about 60 65 cows and this

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,680
is on 240 acre. Um and we're trying to

78
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,680
minimize offfarmm inputs. So at at the

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,720
aronomy farm, we're growing these crops

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,680
at 120th the size, but we're still using

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,959
farm scale equipment.

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,599
And so when we scale this up on our 240

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,080
acre farm, we have 100 acres that are

84
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,720
committed to the alphalfpha mixtures. We

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,680
have 40 acres to corn silage. And then

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,159
our grain co crops, we have 20 um for

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,319
corn, grains, soybeans, and wheat, which

88
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,879
the wheat is we're using for the straw

89
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,959
or the bedding component. and we have 40

90
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,040
acres that are in canola. And then we

91
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,440
have cover crops which are rye and red

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,440
clover. And so what we're taking from

93
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,080
from this is we're looking at the crop

94
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,080
yields and we're looking at the quality.

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,760
And I know in some of the sessions today

96
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,560
there's been um and yesterday we're

97
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,560
talking about models. Well, as Dan

98
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,000
mentioned, one of my roles is managing

99
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,959
the um university dairy. And so not only

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,959
do I use the model, but our dairy herd

101
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,480
is getting fed a ration very similar to

102
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,599
what we're doing here in the virtual

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,079
farm. So what I'm doing here is that

104
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,000
when the when dairy herd goes up in

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,240
production, our virtual farm probably

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,160
does. When they go down because of

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,160
temperature, heat stress, our virtual

108
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,800
farm goes down. So I am using a real

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,160
life herd to um mimic what we're doing

110
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,720
here for our virtual farm.

111
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,400
So, um, our dairy herd, here's what it

112
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,880
looks like. And I want to emphasize this

113
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,400
is a startup dairy. Um, this created

114
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,720
some challenge when we're starting this

115
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
project because if we were to assume we

116
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,720
were established farm, we would have to

117
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,560
make a whole lot of assumptions about

118
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,160
how much previous inventory we would

119
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,080
have. And to me, that seemed like it was

120
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,759
going to muddy the waters a lot. And in

121
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,360
Pennsylvania, we do have farms that do

122
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,759
start up this way. So, this is not

123
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,560
unrealistic. And this way, we're we're

124
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,639
starting with a clean slate. Um, so we

125
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,600
have 65 milking cows and they're

126
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,039
averaging about 34 kilos. But we have

127
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,240
the other animals on the farm that we

128
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,800
have to take into account. So we have

129
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,039
the dry cows and we have all the heers.

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,840
And this herd officially started its

131
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:20,479
rations on November 1st um, 2010.

132
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,240
And in this scenario, we are in a tie

133
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,840
stall barn. And here's a picture for

134
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,800
those of you that may not have seen what

135
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,400
a tie stall stall barn looks like. And

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,880
in this farm, we do feed a total

137
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,639
extraction to the lactating cows. And we

138
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,280
have the dry cows and heers, which get a

139
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,680
partial TMR, which means that usually we

140
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,479
have some additional forages that that

141
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,360
are fed outside of the TMR. And we have

142
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,919
five upright silos. Now, from when doing

143
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,320
this from the economic standpoint, um,

144
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,240
Timbeck, the farm management, so we've

145
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,960
taken into account that we've had to

146
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,560
take out loans to, um, because we

147
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,120
already had some of these facilities in

148
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,360
place, but we had to upgrade them. So,

149
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,440
we actually have the um financial part

150
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,800
of it using FINAC that takes into

151
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,120
account that this farm has had to take

152
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,560
out loans, there's capital purchases or

153
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,759
all of that. So we have a pretty

154
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,080
complicated intensive um economic part

155
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,840
that's taking into account um what this

156
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,160
farm would have to do if it was starting

157
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,880
up. And we are taking into account that

158
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,000
we are um accounting for losses during

159
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,120
storage and feed out.

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,560
Um our rations which are similar to what

161
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,280
we're feeding at the Penn State herd.

162
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,319
We're feeding at 65% forgebased ration

163
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,639
35% concentrate heavy forage rations for

164
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,319
the dried cows and peppers. And we're

165
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,479
using the models to formulate for

166
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,240
metabolizable protein, which is what

167
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,720
we're also doing at Penn State. So our

168
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,560
our protein in the ration is between 15

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,840
and 16% in the diet.

170
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,840
So I'm going to share with you some of

171
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,319
the information now that we have three

172
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,400
years worth of data. And so this is a

173
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,840
summary inventory of the best management

174
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,720
practice and the best management

175
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,840
practice enhanced. And here for corn

176
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,800
silage, um 2010 we had very good yields.

177
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,120
We had very good weather. um we average

178
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,599
I think it came to about 19 tons to the

179
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,240
acre which was very typical for farms in

180
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,560
Pennsylvania during that year. However,

181
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,319
you can see what happened in 2011 and

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,400
2012. We are feeling the drought. We're

183
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,800
feeling some of this weird weather that

184
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,720
we've experienced in Pennsylvania and

185
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,960
that has started to reflect in what

186
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,800
we've been getting in our inventory um

187
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,840
for 2011 and 2012.

188
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,880
Then if we look at our hay crop forage,

189
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,599
um, keep in mind that in 2010,

190
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,520
primarily everything was a new seeding.

191
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,520
So when we're looking at our alpha alpha

192
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,520
and our alpha alpha grass mixtures, we

193
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,960
had very low yields that first year

194
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,240
because we were only probably getting

195
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,919
either one or two cutings off of it. um

196
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,479
2011.

197
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,440
As far as moisture content, we did very

198
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,000
well at getting um multiple cutings off

199
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,520
of our alpha alpha and alpha alpha grass

200
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,840
mixtures. However, in 2012, we had a

201
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,160
very unusual spring. It got very warm.

202
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
Yes.

203
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,440
Yeah. Could you tell me what the units

204
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,800
are talking about?

205
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,360
We're talking about tons.

206
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,919
Tons.

207
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
Yes.

208
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,440
Dry or wet?

209
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,360
No, this is wet.

210
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,400
Sorry about that. I missed that. Um

211
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,120
yeah, we're talking asphed times.

212
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,479
Um and you can see in our um best

213
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,320
management practice enhanced um in 2012,

214
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,159
we took a a big drop in in inventory

215
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,080
because of the type of weather that we

216
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,680
had. So this had was very detrimental

217
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,479
and this was something that our farms in

218
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,279
Pennsylvania dealt with. So what we had

219
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,839
to do here um when I have a hay crop

220
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,000
forge plus annuals, we had to do what a

221
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,839
lot of producers had to do. We had to

222
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,680
incorporate small grain and we had to

223
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,320
incorporate sorghum sudan. We had to

224
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,160
look at alternative forages because from

225
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,320
the farm standpoint of what I needed to

226
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,240
feed the cows, we were going to come up

227
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,040
very short.

228
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,600
And you can see that um in here in the

229
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,160
enhanced we had small brains which

230
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,120
boosted our inventory. And you can see

231
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,320
how the additional especially here in

232
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,720
our enhance with um moving that from 589

233
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,080
tons with the sorghum sedan boosted that

234
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,440
up to 983 tons. This is part of the

235
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,640
story that we're trying to get to our

236
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,959
producers that you've got to be

237
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,040
flexible. you've got to be able to, you

238
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,000
know, know what you're feeding and make

239
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,279
decisions to sort of um compensate for

240
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,640
some of the the weather issues that

241
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,920
we're dealing with, which goes with the

242
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,160
climate change that we were talking

243
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,920
about yesterday, is this is a real

244
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,839
effect that we're dealing with.

245
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,959
And then the next is to look at the

246
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,720
quality of some of the um ingredients

247
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,560
that we're harvesting. And and I'm

248
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,120
sharing here um some of the challenges

249
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,880
that we had early on with the canola and

250
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,200
the soybeans. Um, under the canola meal,

251
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,640
the typical is what we would be for the

252
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,560
solvent extracted. Um, 40.8% protein, 4%

253
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,240
fat.

254
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,839
But what when we're harvesting the

255
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,519
canola, we're doing mechanical

256
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,760
extraction. And if you look at 2010, we

257
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,240
had very low protein and we had a very

258
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,760
high fat content in the canola. And what

259
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
we found out is that the moisture

260
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,519
content was too high and we didn't do a

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,200
good job of extracting the oil out. Um,

262
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,360
then in 2011 and 2012, uh, we did a much

263
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,480
better job and we're seem to be staying

264
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,000
around at this 11 12% fat. Ideally, from

265
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,399
a nutritionist, I'd like to see if we

266
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,279
could get that lower, but we do seem to,

267
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,959
um, be doing a little bit better

268
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:49,440
with our soybeans. Um, this is typical

269
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:53,440
for us in the box, 41.8. 8% protein, 18%

270
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,399
fat. Um, the first year in 2010, we

271
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,279
found out that we were short on pod ash.

272
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,240
And so that had a uh negative effect on

273
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,880
the protein and also on the fat content.

274
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,800
So that was corrected. And you can see

275
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,760
now in 2011 and 2012 um our analysis is

276
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,720
looking very um close to what we would

277
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,720
typically expect for soybeans.

278
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,760
If you look at our corn silage analyses

279
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,640
and um I just picked this out because

280
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,959
most of us um work with corn silage but

281
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,440
for any of the forages um we have not

282
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,079
seen any differences between um the

283
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,760
strategies between um the broadcast

284
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,079
manure which is the best management

285
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,560
practice and the ejected manure which is

286
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,519
the enhanced and these analysis are very

287
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,320
typical of what we see at Penn State for

288
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,519
the corn silage that's harvest harvested

289
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,519
for the university herd.

290
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,440
So what the monthly events are that that

291
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,360
I'm responsible for is that I need to

292
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,279
formulate the diets for all the animal

293
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,839
groups. And so each month I'm tracking

294
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,839
the inventory um that we're feeding out

295
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,240
for the various animal groups. I

296
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,240
calculate the grain mix costs and I

297
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,320
track income over feed costs.

298
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,519
And so let me just um get you familiar

299
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,920
with this um graph a little bit. So

300
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,079
income over feed cost is taking the milk

301
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,360
income which is calculated from the milk

302
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,360
price and what the average milk

303
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,240
production is and we're subtracting off

304
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,040
the feed cost and this is on a per cow

305
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,320
per day basis. And so when you look at

306
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,040
the um far axis here the the numbers. So

307
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,160
when you see here in 2011 we got to a

308
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,800
high of $12. That means that's $12

309
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,480
income over feed cost after we paid all

310
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,880
the feed expenses for the lactating

311
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,200
cows. So that's how much money is left

312
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,519
over to pay all the other expenses on

313
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,600
the farm. And if any of you have been

314
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,560
familiar with the dairy industry, you

315
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,240
know that 2012 was not a very good year.

316
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,160
And that's reflected in the income over

317
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,920
fee cost. And and this is something that

318
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,519
we're trying to look at and track and

319
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,320
see how do these different cropping

320
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,200
strategies um how how do we weather the

321
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,959
storm during these low times.

322
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,959
So we have the blue which is the

323
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,320
enhanced best management practice and

324
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,200
the red is just the the um standard best

325
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,320
management practices. But we have seen

326
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,279
here during two times that the enhanced

327
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,639
practices has showed a slight advantage

328
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:26,720
in income over feed cost.

329
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,360
And the reason for this is one forge

330
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,839
quality. We had um weather challenges

331
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,920
with the alphalfpha grass silage quality

332
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,360
in the best management practice enhanced

333
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,639
scenario and I had to feed between 40 to

334
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,279
43% concentrate and heavier corn silage

335
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,399
in 2011. Now you're probably thinking,

336
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,839
well that doesn't make sense. You're

337
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,000
feeding more concentrate. You'd think

338
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,839
that that would be more expensive.

339
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,079
However, we're we're growing our own

340
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,959
corn. We're growing our own soybeans and

341
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,519
we're growing our own canola meal. And

342
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,839
when you take in the price of what we're

343
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,000
raising on farm and putting in here, it

344
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,880
actually was economically a little bit

345
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,040
more advantageous than um the regular

346
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,279
BMP strategy.

347
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,839
The other um scenario that came through

348
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,240
was the effect of forage inventory. We

349
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,680
had no carryover of corn silage for the

350
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,079
regular BMP scenario for fall of 2012

351
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,160
and we had to feed fresh corn silage.

352
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,839
And those of us that deal with nutrition

353
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,079
know that when you have to feed fresh

354
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,320
corn silage, you have a negative impact

355
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,639
on milk production. So we saw a negative

356
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,720
effect on milk production. However, in

357
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,120
our in enhanced scenario, we had a

358
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,800
two-month carryover of corn silage. So

359
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,440
we were able to maintain or increase

360
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,800
milk production. So we're seeing how the

361
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,560
inventory and quality are impacting um

362
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,760
sort of the economics of these different

363
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,560
farm scenarios.

364
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,560
Okay, this is giving you um a little bit

365
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,760
and this may be more economics than what

366
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,680
you want to be um digesting right now.

367
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,720
So, we're looking at the cost prices for

368
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,000
crops grown in 2010 on on the BMP

369
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,800
scenario and on the enhanced. So, if you

370
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,079
look over here in the far left,

371
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,399
every month I do a feed price list. And

372
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,959
so, these are this is the average market

373
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:19,279
price dollar per ton for 2011.

374
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,959
So, for example, corn silage for that

375
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,959
year averaged $33 a ton. And then you

376
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,079
can see what it actually cost us to

377
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,480
produce the forages in the different

378
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,959
scenarios, which we were pretty close.

379
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,360
This is not a good thing. Um, we should

380
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,519
be a lot lower, but um you're seeing

381
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,079
that our costs are pretty close to what

382
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,880
the market price is. Where you really

383
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,639
see the impact during our first year is

384
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,880
in the alpha alpha grass silage and the

385
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,440
alpha alpha hay because they were new

386
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,759
seedings. We had very limited cutings.

387
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,839
So the inputs are staying the same

388
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,680
whether you had two cutings or four to

389
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,880
five cutings. So that's why you're

390
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,440
seeing very high prices for um alpha

391
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,519
alpha um silage mixes whether as silage

392
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,560
or as hay.

393
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:10,480
But you can see what we did here on our

394
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,199
corn soy. Um what it cost us to produce

395
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,759
it was much lower than what it would be

396
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,480
if you had to pay for it um based on the

397
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,320
market. And because this was the first

398
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,519
time doing the canola, you can see that

399
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,800
our unit prices um were pretty high. But

400
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,440
we should know that this includes um the

401
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,079
canola takes into account not only the

402
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,519
meal but also the oil. So that's why we

403
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,199
have it's a little bit higher than what

404
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:40,639
you would have seen on the market.

405
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:44,880
The good news is now for the crops grown

406
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,800
in 2011 but were fed in 2012.

407
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,720
Here you can see what the difference in

408
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,920
the market prices for the various

409
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,560
forages. However, again looking at corn

410
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,480
silage, our cost to produce the corn

411
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,720
silage was a little bit less than

412
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,519
market. But we now we've had a

413
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,240
substantial impact on our hay crop

414
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,559
forages. What has cost us to raise it is

415
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,400
much lower than the market price. And

416
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,439
again, this is because we got four to

417
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,160
five cutings off of those crops. And

418
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,240
we're still doing a very good job as far

419
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,880
as what's it costing us to produce the

420
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:23,559
corn and the soybeans. And our price of

421
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,559
the canola meal has come down.

422
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,160
So the question that that people have

423
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,160
been asking is how does the virtual

424
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,240
dairy startup farm and I have to

425
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,919
emphasize startup compared to

426
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,080
established Pennsylvania dairy

427
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,679
operations and one of the things is we

428
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,360
work with Pennsylvania um dairy

429
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,559
producers and doing their cash flow

430
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,360
plans. So we we have this information

431
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,280
and so we're looking at the summary data

432
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,480
of the farms that we've worked with and

433
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:54,799
in 2011 the purchase fee cost per cow

434
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,840
was about uh $1,200 $1,300

435
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,679
compared to our um different scenarios

436
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,160
which are about half of that. So our

437
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,960
purchase feed cost on our scenarios are

438
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,600
are very very low. And you can see in

439
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,799
2012 when feed prices were high, we were

440
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,400
up to almost $1,500 per cal, but yet in

441
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,480
our two scenarios, we're still

442
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,400
maintaining about half of the purchased

443
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,160
feed cost.

444
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,080
Now, when you look at the break even

445
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,840
income over feed cost, and this is after

446
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,919
we're doing a complete complete cash

447
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,080
flow, so we're taking into the whole

448
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,120
fixed cost, operating expenses,

449
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,200
everything. Our farms in Pennsylvania

450
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,919
are having break even income over feed

451
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:39,679
costs around $7.50 50 up to $7.76

452
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:42,240
for 2011 and 2012. You can see for our

453
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,679
two scenarios, we're up around $10. This

454
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,000
is not very good. If this was an

455
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,480
established farm, they would be in a lot

456
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,679
of trouble. For a startup farm, this is

457
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,880
not unrealistic. The good news is that

458
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,960
from 2011 to 2012, we've come down. So,

459
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,960
we're moving in the right direction. And

460
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,360
we're looking at our BMP enhanced is

461
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,200
actually showing a slight advantage. And

462
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,799
now we're getting into an area that

463
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,280
we're becoming a little bit more

464
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,600
competitive. And I would say as we start

465
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,600
doing this project over multiple years,

466
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,679
we we will be more of an established

467
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:18,240
farm and not so much a startup farm.

468
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,240
So now going back to the graph that I

469
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,240
showed you earlier on income over feed

470
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,480
cost.

471
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,039
This is based off of using market prices

472
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,960
for homeraised feeds. The reason why we

473
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,960
do that is because the farms that we

474
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,200
work with, a lot of them do not know

475
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,600
what it costs them to produce feed. So

476
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,919
this way we can compare apples to apples

477
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,840
when we're comparing farms. But now I've

478
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,960
given you what the break even numbers

479
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,200
are for our farms. The blue is the BMP

480
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,760
enhanced. The red is are just our

481
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,240
general best management practices. But

482
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,880
you can see on the dotted line where our

483
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,600
break even is. So when we're above our

484
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,080
break even, we're making money. When

485
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,240
we're below the break even, we're losing

486
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,200
money. So, we're trying to say is that

487
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,960
we want to now here in 2012, a lot of

488
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,600
producers were not making any money.

489
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,280
They were losing it, but we want to make

490
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,600
getting this break even number. We want

491
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,400
to keep getting that down so that

492
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,240
there's more times than we're making um

493
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,039
profit.

494
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,200
However, when you look at the cost, so

495
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,160
this is taking into the cost to produce

496
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,480
our feeds. How did we do on our break

497
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,039
even? So, this is showing the dollars

498
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,799
above or below break even. We were above

499
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,919
our break even. So, even though our

500
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:37,039
break even number was $10, we were still

501
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,720
the first year 2011 were making 42 cents

502
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:46,640
on average per cow. Um, and our enhanced

503
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:50,799
$151 in 2012 for the regular BMP $1.72

504
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:53,039
and the enhanced $218. So it looks like

505
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,360
right now that our enhanced best

506
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,080
management practice is showing a slight

507
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,799
advantage in what we're making um per

508
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,960
pal.

509
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,120
So, in conclusion, um the value of this

510
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,440
project is evaluating the sustainability

511
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,039
of the practices over time. And I think

512
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,200
over time is what we really need to

513
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,600
emphasize because now we're starting to

514
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,320
to see the weather effects, how the

515
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,960
inventory and the quality is impacting

516
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,640
um the enterprise. In our economic

517
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,640
analysis, we're doing both the whole

518
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,600
farm system as well as the dairy

519
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,440
enterprise. In the one scenario, we may

520
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,280
have more additional feed that we can

521
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,679
sell, which is going to be a positive

522
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,159
for the um enterprise, but we also want

523
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,919
to see is the dairy able to be

524
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,880
sustainable on its own without

525
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,559
generating additional income. Um,

526
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,960
generating the canola meal in the

527
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,240
straight vegetable oil as a fuel source

528
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,320
is a novel concept and this project can

529
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,120
be scaled down to evaluate herds that

530
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,760
have a limited land base. Um the way

531
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,080
that this um project is set up, we can

532
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,520
go in and change numbers. So if we if we

533
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,600
had a 65 cow lactating herd on only 150

534
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,880
acres, we can put that in there and see

535
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,559
what the impact of our different

536
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,440
cropping strategies would have on that.

537
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,440
Um in the proceedings, um you have links

538
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,919
to the detailed information about this

539
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,000
project. Um one of the things that's

540
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,640
been very popular with the producers is

541
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,760
the impact of slugs. Um, slugs are a

542
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,200
major pest for us and have had I think

543
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,159
the slugs um and and some of the insects

544
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,000
that have affected our crops. That's

545
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,320
been one of the challenges here in in

546
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
these different cropping strategies. Um,

547
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,039
but yeah, there there's a lot more going

548
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,240
on than what I presented um here. So, if

549
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,159
you wanted to get more information about

550
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,960
the project, that's where you can find

551
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,200
it.

552
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,200
Thank you.
