1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,720
when most of us think of natural

2
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,760
resource protection

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,519
or wildlife habitat images of vast

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,920
expanses of open land

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,239
and unbounded water probably come to

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,239
mind

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
but to hundreds of species of animals

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,239
and insects

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,079
home is where they find it

10
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,239
and many of them would love to find

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,239
their home in your backyard

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,879
your yard can be rich with life using

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:59,840
the conservation practices you'll see in

14
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,840
the next few minutes

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,519
these methods have been used

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,680
successfully in the countryside by

17
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,680
america's farmers and ranchers for years

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,400
in miniature with some adapting they'll

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,400
work in your yard too

20
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,759
and this can be done regardless of the

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
size of your yard

22
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,320
or if you have a brand new home or an

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
existing one

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,159
like your neighbors in the country

25
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,479
you'll soon discover that by making your

26
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,640
yard more hospitable to nature

27
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:41,840
you'll add pleasure to your life and

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:41,840
harmony around your home

29
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,560
an easy way to get started on a more

30
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,399
diverse backyard is to plant trees and

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,759
shrubs

32
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,240
let your children or those in the

33
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,119
neighborhood help it can be one of those

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,520
pleasant

35
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,040
life-long family memories like the day

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,520
you helped plant a tree

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,920
built a tree house or put up a backyard

38
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,920
swing

39
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,959
trees and shrubs soothe the soul

40
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,200
homeowners and farmers alike plant them

41
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,920
for many of the same reasons

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,920
shade energy savings and soil savings

43
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,120
trees and shrubs also help make a more

44
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:27,599
beautiful landscape and provide space

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,599
and habitat for nature's creatures

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,920
as a matter of fact private landowners

47
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,080
provide the bulk of the food and habitat

48
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,840
for wildlife in this country

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
they deserve the credit for making a

50
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,440
home for wildlife

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,440
on a whopping 70 percent of the land

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,200
in your backyard you can simply change

53
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,440
the scale

54
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,640
and the species of wildlife you want to

55
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,800
attract

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,920
look to plant trees and shrubs that

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,840
offer fruits

58
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,640
berries nuts and insects for the

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,680
wildlife you want

60
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,560
for some small birds such as the warbler

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,560
a meal from a tree in your yard just

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,280
might be the difference in a successful

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,280
migration

64
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
native plants and wildflowers are good

65
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,680
ideas too

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,120
they lure butterflies hummingbirds and

67
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,080
other wildlife

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,400
add a mix of plants to your backyard and

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,040
you

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,040
and your family may soon see wildlife

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,519
you never dreamed of seeing so close to

72
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,519
your home

73
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,440
on the farm sometimes the trees shrub

74
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,440
and grass plantings don't offer enough

75
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,360
food or cover for wildlife

76
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,360
so some farmers plant food plots

77
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,440
especially for wildlife

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,560
or put up structures geese and ducks and

79
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,760
birds can use

80
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,239
as protected nests

81
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,319
in your yard the extra food and cover

82
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,120
may come from simple bird feeders

83
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,120
small nest boxes or other bird houses

84
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,000
when it comes to welcoming wildlife and

85
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,120
adding tranquility and beauty

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,599
nothing beats water especially ponds and

87
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,599
wetlands

88
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,439
although these conservation projects

89
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,920
require planning

90
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,480
and some maintenance small backyard

91
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,199
ponds

92
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,639
water gardens and wetlands provide many

93
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,440
benefits for birds

94
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
butterflies frogs and fish not to

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,840
mention

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,240
the rewards they give you and your

97
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,840
family

98
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,680
but if you're worried about the extra

99
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,479
effort involved for a pond or water

100
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,320
garden

101
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,479
your water source option can be as

102
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,160
simple and inexpensive

103
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,479
as a bird bath of course

104
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,160
managing and conserving water is just as

105
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,440
important in your backyard

106
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,080
as it is on farms and ranches

107
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,680
it makes sense to save water wherever

108
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,520
you live

109
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,520
reducing the amount of grass you need to

110
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,000
water is one solution

111
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,199
you can design your yard to include more

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,280
native grasses

113
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,479
and less lawn grass that you would have

114
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,440
to fertilize

115
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,440
weed and mow

116
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,360
if you need to water your garden

117
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,960
consider installing a more efficient

118
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,120
irrigation system

119
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,800
drip irrigation systems deliver water

120
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,960
directly to the plants

121
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,440
and may soon pay for themselves in water

122
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,560
savings and increase production

123
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,080
conservationists also want to conserve

124
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,120
and recycle waste

125
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,880
and build healthy soil on the farm

126
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,240
animal and plant wastes are returned to

127
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,720
the land to enrich the soil

128
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,560
that can be done in the backyard too by

129
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,520
composting

130
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,280
composting is easy it turns lawn debris

131
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,000
and fruit and vegetable waste

132
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,440
such as melon rinds and banana peels

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,360
into organic matter

134
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,360
that makes high quality soil

135
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,720
here are a few more conservation

136
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,360
techniques you can use to improve your

137
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,639
yard

138
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,600
and the environment like your neighbors

139
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,520
in the country

140
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,759
you'll want to test your soil before you

141
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,840
add nutrients or fertilizers

142
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,319
and put them only where you need them

143
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,560
and in just the right amounts this not

144
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,120
only makes for healthier plant life

145
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,840
but it also saves money and helps keep

146
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,759
our water

147
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,080
clean and when it comes to pesticides

148
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,280
the best conservation advice is

149
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,759
prevention

150
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,199
when you can plant disease and pest

151
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,759
resistant species

152
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,800
and introduce beneficial insects such as

153
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,000
the ladybug

154
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,000
and praying mantis

155
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,880
when you need pesticides pinpoint the

156
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,400
problem

157
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,840
and read and follow the label

158
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
instructions carefully

159
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,919
mulching is a good way to protect your

160
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,240
soil from erosion

161
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,600
cut down on weed growth and conserve

162
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,520
soil moisture

163
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,720
you can recycle the materials in your

164
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,720
own yard as mulch

165
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,720
one last conservation technique is

166
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,479
terracing

167
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,319
although terracing might involve more

168
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,080
initial expense and effort

169
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,240
it's an excellent way to increase

170
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,280
gardening areas and to reduce soil

171
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,919
erosion

172
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,639
plus it can add beautiful architectural

173
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,919
touches

174
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,919
to yards and gardens

175
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,680
conservation whether in the countryside

176
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,720
or in the city

177
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,440
starts with a personal commitment

178
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,360
by farmers and ranchers who keep soil

179
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,840
productive and water clean

180
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,840
and share their big yards with fish and

181
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
wildlife

182
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,080
by neighbors who come together to

183
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,280
develop their parks as a place of

184
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,280
harmony and diversity

185
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,080
and by homeowners who provide a

186
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,599
sanctuary in their backyards

187
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,599
for butterflies and birds

188
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,479
together we can make our homes our

189
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,039
neighborhoods

190
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,160
and our earth a friendlier better place

191
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,840
to live

192
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,840
one yard at a time

193
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,599
when you look at all the different

194
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,599
plants and what we have here

195
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,039
the maintenance has been surprisingly

196
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,000
simple

197
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,280
but now that we have this yard we're out

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,440
in the yard more

199
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,039
on the weekends not just to cut the

200
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,280
grass not just for maintenance but to

201
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,000
really enjoy it

202
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,400
and there's a certain pride and you know

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
just

204
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,520
i think anybody would feel that way and

205
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,440
we enjoy having

206
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,880
friends come over because they enjoy the

207
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,959
yard

208
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,919
but you know i wish i had done it a long

209
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,640
time ago

210
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,159
i'd have been more involved in the yard

211
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,120
because i didn't realize how much

212
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,120
enjoyment

213
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,279
there are a lot of rewards they really

214
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,680
are

215
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:55,839
once you get into it it's a lot of fun

216
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,839
it really

217
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
you
