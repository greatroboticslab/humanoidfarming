00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,880
hi I'm buzz and I'm Barrett now

2
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,400
something is happening in the world of

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,320
Agriculture call it soil Health

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,599
sustainable farming maybe even

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,560
regenerative agriculture however you

6
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,359
want to label it it's happening and soil

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,960
scientist Dr Ray wild describes it like

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,640
this I think we're in a stage now I

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,640
actually think we're in a revolution

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,879
it's just a you know such an exciting

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,520
time to be in agriculture

12
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,480
after really A Century of Agriculture

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,160
kind of going downhill production going

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,520
up but in a very unsustainable way and

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,039
actually in a way that isn't even

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,840
sustaining Farmers so the average age of

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,520
farmers kept creeping up so it's in the

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,000
60s now and now we're entering a period

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,640
where some of the uh leading innovative

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,960
Farmers definitely the farmers are

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,560
leading this so part of the controversy

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,720
is that the scientists are are chasing

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,280
behind and and you know these things

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,520
seem to work can we explain why they're

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,159
working we don't know there's a lot we

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,320
don't know which makes science exciting

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,400
if we knew it all we retire right and

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,520
this is what's making so many farmers

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,840
and ranchers in South Dakota excited and

30
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,159
nrcs state conservationist Jeff zdge

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,079
gets it I got a chance to be out out in

32
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,880
the field I got a chance to visit with

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,360
our staff got a chance to visit with

34
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,880
producers and just seeing this

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,399
incredible interest in this topic it

36
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,000
just seemed to me like what was going to

37
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,680
be able to make our state successful was

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,520
if we had the healthiest soils possible

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,200
and so I really believe it's the most

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,159
important thing we can focus on so soil

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,719
health is a slam dunk right well not

42
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,159
quite and the big picture is that no

43
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,960
till acreage is still climbing and South

44
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,640
Dakota but it's not across the board

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,640
we've seen a leveling off in some

46
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,119
counties and even a loss of no till

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,840
acreage in others and that also has

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,440
Jeff's attention so the first thing is

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,959
we got to start finding out why right

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,920
and pretty much anytime that you get out

51
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,560
amongst producers there's going to be

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,160
folks that are going to

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,879
go well yeah it could work there but it

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,160
won't work on my farm and here's why and

55
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,840
so we heard issues like um my soils are

56
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,120
too wet my soils are too cold I have too

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,040
much residue um I can't plant that

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,879
rotation because that's not economical

59
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,080
for me and the list goes on while we

60
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,959
heard those things it gets kind of

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,720
perplexing because you look right across

62
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,120
the road and then there's a producer

63
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,879
that's doing it and being very

64
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,400
successful so this whole idea of trying

65
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,080
to research this stuff bring together

66
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,120
the researchers bring together the

67
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,519
people who are doing it on the landscape

68
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,920
and try to really dig deeper and kind of

69
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,080
find out if we can explain maybe why

70
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,360
they're concerned about it but maybe why

71
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,599
they're concerned about it is not real

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,599
true and so our job is to do the deeper

73
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:13,239
digging we'll be speaking to people in

74
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:17,040
the lab and on the land and we'll be the

75
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:21,040
guys asking Merit or myth we'll post

76
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,239
this material as videos blogs Vlogs and

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,560
podcasts and now I'm really getting

78
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,480
excited we look forward to visiting with

79
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,799
you all at Merit or myth stay tuned

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,799
because this will be fun f
