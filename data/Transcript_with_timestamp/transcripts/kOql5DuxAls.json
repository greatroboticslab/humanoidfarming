  "text": "um and i like how you just mentioned the technicalities around sprouting and on the fact that we also need to farm potatoes with irrigation because you know without water farming does become a little bit tricky especially with high value crops such as potatoes so you know we've had a lot of rains around december january february period and um with with your knowledge and and maybe the farmers that you've worked with how have they mitigated the risk [Music] [Music] good day podcasters thank you so much for joining the private property farming podcast bringing to you yet another episode of the farming podcast discussing all things agriculture um as i always mentioned on the show is that if you have any topics comments questions that you want to share with us please do reach

be focusing on potato farming you know pro how do you make profit out of potatoes um how do you farm potatoes the pros and cons of farming potatoes or maybe broadening it a little bit um into venturing into vegetable farming uh if you don't know about bayer um i guess you should take out your laptop your phone and just google them they're a big international company that deals with crop protection pesticides a lot of varieties and i think andre is going to be able to unpack some of their services and what they do particularly in his portfolio and let's just tap into his expertise um just to learn more about potato farming the pros and cons around vegetable farming how do we make a profit out of it how do we grow our farming enterprises to become profitable over and above the pressures that we as farmers face and maybe tap into the valley chain as well so if you have any questions like always to mr andre please feel free to comment um let's get straight into it and introduce andre andre thank you so much for joining us how are you doing uh thank you very much now i'm doing well yes uh just uh thank you for that introduction um my title with buyer is the go to market manager for potatoes and vegetables in south africa so yes um i'm glad to be on your show today happiness happiness so firstly maybe just explain to us what does bayer what does the company bear do um and specifically when you're saying you're the go-to market manager what does that exactly mean molly is a very big company a global company we are in pharmaceuticals we in [Music] seed and we in crop science as well so yes my responsibility is the development of strategy and alignment of uh the sales people in field to uh to to to align with our strategy uh for the future and and so on so yes they the go-to-market strategy leader or is is somebody that is very knowledgeable in the field of of his expertise and he or her um sort of show the way for the future and that is in short my responsibility uh with bayer at this stage fantastic so um today we mentioned that we're going to talk about potato farming because i believe that it's also your area of expertise so maybe just break it down to it what you know if one wants to venture into potato farming um what type of land size should i be considering what are the best regions to farm potatoes and how does one make a success out of potato farming in bali yes potatoes in south africa is planted right through the season right room from summer right through to winter there's always somebody that plant potatoes and somebody that always fresh potatoes so we in a fortunate position that you know there is certain areas in south africa that they plant potatoes like in the halting area western free state and kozulu natal and they are in the western cape okay you ask me what is the important thing about potatoes say for instance if you want to start with potatoes the first thing is that you have to do your research raw potatoes fit into in that area is it suitable to plant your potatoes in that area is the soil suitable to plant potatoes what is the the pest and diseases that can attack your potatoes and lastly uh is also the end of the day you have to send your final product to the fresh produce market or to the processors or one of those markets so you have to investigate those markets the because the end of the day you have to make money to to to to produce uh to do plant potatoes potatoes is very expensive that variant from a hundred thousand rent eight up to two hundred to two hundred and fifty thousand run the hectare so it's very very expensive so you can't afford to make a mistake so my first uh to answer your question first of all do your own work see if it will fit into your rotation fit in your form and another thing is with potatoes we always say you need the the the implements you need you have to have a plant you have to have irrigation you have to have a lifter you have to have a sprayer and lastly you have to have a sorting space where you can sort your potatoes so it is a high input cost the second do secondly i will say start small and grow into it so that if you if you make a mistake it's on a smaller scale and you don't have a you know you you you you manage your risk on a smaller scale as we if you open the gates and you start and you plant big hectares you know the risk is just too high and your input cost is very very high in potatoes yes and then there's quite a few things other that you can make use of this a lot of expertise in the field um you know your your distribution companies that distribute chemicals and and fertilizers and so on they have very knowledgeable people in the specific areas that will guide you to make a success if you want to start the plant potatoes another thing is what a potato grower mistake in consideration is remember you plant seed potatoes and that is a tuber that is produced by a seed grower and always buy certified seed because there is a guarantee on certified seed uh that you also as part of your whole process of manage risk uh at the end of the day okay and then lastly is potatoes is economical of scale you have to have a high yield a high youth and high quality of potatoes market at the right time at the right market to get the right at the the best uh price for your or for your potatoes these are it sounds very technical you know everything that you're saying about um yes your advice is to say start small so that you know when you do fail at least you don't lose as much in your investment as opposed to going big um and i like how you just mentioned the technicalities around sprouting around the fact that we also need to farm potatoes with irrigation because you know without water farming does become a little bit tricky especially with high value crops such as potatoes so you know we've had a lot of rains around december january february period and um with with your knowledge and and maybe uh the farmers that you've worked with how have they um mitigated the risks or still kept their farm businesses in survival mode rather in survival mode with all these climate change um different variables happening in various parts of the provinces in the country molly yes um the the potato farmer uh he must watch the weather because potatoes is very acceptable in chains of weather patterns and if you just look at the spray program and if you see there is a coat from coming in of a lot of rain you must spray preventative for certain diseases and my advice to a farmer is do not wait until the disease or the pest is on the farm create or develop a spray pro program that is preventative a good measurement is what you do before flowering determines your your success hour after flowering so yes okay in bayern we have quite a we have a very nice portfolio to a microvision for all the different pests and diseases that you can pick up during the growing season if i can just start at uh when you plant it at planting there's a big problem with two things that you must keep in mind first of all is nematodes so we have a product with the name of villam prime that control nematodes and the second one there is uh imester solvers one of our new uh products that we will launch we're busy launching it and that cro uh control raza those two uh products play a vital role in the appearance of your potato that you want to sell to the housewife the potatoes as well research it after products as well research and if you use it according to the label uh you will have good results okay so we covered the the planting and what's happening under the soil and secondly when the potatoes start to grow then there's a fungus fungus diseases that can attack your potatoes and there is certain insects that can attack your potatoes and therefore we have um a good portfolio we have uh folic nativo infinitu for the fungus diseases and then we have dieses buddha can belt to control your moth diseases and there's other companies that also supply products to control for instance leaf miner we can't we can't supply everything to them to the potato growers so you have to make use of other companies that that support a spraying program during the season okay come back to your original question about the weather and and and so on yes weather is a critical factor if you have too much rain you your fertilizer reach out and your blonde come under stress and then they develop them certain diseases and so on so you always have to measure what happened with the weather and what you're gonna do during the growing season so if you look at the growing season of potatoes it's anything between three ah four to five months that the potatoes grow and you have to make provision for your pests and your diseases every seven to ten days you have to spray and that's part of the input cost at the end of the day okay the weather is also important especially in the eastern free state where there is quite a bit of uh dryland uh plantings that uh taking place so those farmers depend on rain okay again they don't have irrigation where you can just switch it on and say there is water so the depend for water that we blessed in south africa yes that's a risk so my advice is to eastern free state pharmacists you know you form you know where your best lens is and you know also what is the water capacity in your land use them for potatoes due to the fact that you manage the risk the whole time yes to conclude from buyer we try to advise our farmers to look out uh look at the weather and make a management decision in connection with the agents in the field to prevent anything that can happen during that time where the weather chains or you have lots of rain or all those things so yes we try to advise our farmers to be successful fantastic and sticking on to that advice andre at the start of the production season do you go out do you work with the farmers to say this is how your soil analysis looks like maybe instead of planting a plant population of a hundred thousand you need to maybe do 80 you know or maybe go to 120 do you also assist the farmers with the growing program around pesticide management yes we in bayern we specialized in in crop protection there is some other companies like your fertilizer companies that do the soil analysis and then they recommend the correct fertilizer and blend and and and so on for the farmer uh then there's the seed companies that advise the farmer which seat and which cultivar to use and every area let's call it a set of rules where you know that you have to plant your plant population have to be that so many plants per year and then you will produce a a very high yield from buyer's side for us is that we give a lot of training for our agents in the field we empower them with knowledge and we give them uh access to sell our products in the field that they can with the hope of of the assistance of uh of our area managers in in the different areas that knows the area knows exactly what to look then they developed a crop protection program for the farmer but it is not cast in stone remember what i said about the weather so you have you have something that you can work on but you can change your indecision as a certain problems arise and and you have to make provision for certain things and that's the role of buyer in the production of potatoes yeah tell me andre do you guys work with industry associations because as you're talking i also was reminded that oh there's a potato south africa uh association do you work with the the industry association maybe to bring in um maybe with your partners like the sea partners good varieties do you guys engage with the association to say these are the right pesticides you know for the season maybe from your research and development because i know that organizations like yourselves pride themselves with the quality of inputs that you sell out to the market so my question is do you work with industry associations like potato south africa to give them expert advice on how to successfully grow this commodity bali yes potato south africa and potato certification services is a very very important partner for us due to the fact that we use their plot platforms to introduce new innovation innovation we introduce our new chemistry we communicate with uh our farmers uh but we um we in a partnership that we use their platform or we sponsor platforms that we can can communicate to our farmers out there another important part is what potato certification and potatoes at africa play is that they have information available and as a strategic manager for me is important to if you don't measure you can't manage you know so we use the the platforms where i publicized on on on patellar south africa where a website or certification website we use those information to manage um in south africa you asked me about seed potato seeds we don't have anything to do with potato seed in south africa these other companies that specialized in that um one thing that the potatoes at africa have certain work groups in different areas and we use those work groups to demonstrate cypher instance a buyer product or by a spray program or new innovation and the information that we gather on on on on workgroup level is fantastic for a farmer because it's information that he can use in his area and he gets specific answers for his problem and he can manage risk with those information that we we we collect in in this this is not a strange relationship but everybody make use of this those platforms and work groups to communicate with our client the end of the day and uh client is our farmers absolutely absolutely as i let go of you andre i think you've just you know unpacked this specific commodity quite technically um and it's not a it's not it's not a conversation we have every single day and you've literally displayed the intricacies around potato farming and i guess this is the reason why there's not so many players farming potatoes because yes it is a big staple crop it's a very important one around the south african landscape but also it's very difficult to master so maybe leave us with a fun fact you know um from your knowledge uh do you know how big uh do you know any big potato farmers in south africa you don't have to mention their names but maybe just give us a fun fact of the biggest potato producer is producing one how many uh hectares of land sure yes that is uh yes we have very big seed drivers in the western free state area they produce a lot in high quality of seed and then we have very big potato growers in the eastern free state ryland growers that produce um anything between 300 and 400 to 500 acres at a time and then in the group we have pharmacy between 200 and 408 as well that produce potatoes for south africa but my message to anybody that eat the potato is have respect for that potato because there's a lot of uh work and knowledge and and and the risk and input costs that go into produce a potato it is such an is such a fantastic commodity and it gives for so many people in south africa jobs and and and so on it is just a very exciting industry to be in and for my for my potato farmers the the one thing that i can tell them is all the best for the growing season my provision for the things that you don't know what can happen uh prevention is always better than care and uh you know your success is our success and from by your side we have a big team or a very knowledgeable team in the field that can assist you so that you can be successful the end of the day absolutely thank you so much andre for your time that was a a fantastic conversation and yeah you've left me with that note to say now we must all have respect for our mashed potatoes our sweet potatoes and more so our chips that we consume um for for for consumers around the country so yeah it's a different message that you've put out there but trust me next time i eat a chip i will think of that farming mind thank you molly i really appreciate it and i really enjoyed talking to you likewise that was andrei dutoy the go-to market manager from bayer crops crop division and we were discussing and maybe slightly unpacking down the potato industry basically um getting to know from his uh um advice how many hectares one should start with and he mentioned also besides land it's cricket it's critical to have the right equipment the right mechanization to be able to plant your potatoes um weed uh the areas around your potatoes and more and more importantly harvest the potatoes because it's quite a delicate crop it needs special care and attention and he mentioned that the rough or average um input cost per hectare is about a hundred thousand and it can all go all the way about about up to 200 000 per hectare so you have to make sure that if you're investing in such a niche commodity make sure that you have your ducks in a row reach out to the bayer team who could assist you from a pesticide management perspective um and also work with your seed reps um work with your chemical ribs to really help you uh come up with a very tight growing program that will help you also mitigate your risk once you start your production that's it for me like i said if you have any questions please feel free to reach out and continue to like subscribe in our youtube channel and continue to support the farming podcast see you next [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you",
