1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,519
um and i like how you just mentioned the

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,280
technicalities around sprouting

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,240
and on the fact that we also need to

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
farm potatoes with irrigation because

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,359
you know without water farming does

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,560
become a little bit tricky especially

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,039
with high value crops such as potatoes

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,000
so you know we've had a lot of rains

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,320
around december january february period

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,119
and um with with your knowledge and and

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,519
maybe

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,600
the farmers that you've worked with how

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,480
have they

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:45,490
mitigated the risk

because i believe that it's also your

106
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,759
area of expertise so maybe just break it

107
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,040
down to it what you know if one wants to

108
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,680
venture into potato farming um what type

109
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,360
of land size should i be considering

110
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,479
what are the best regions to farm

111
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,639
potatoes

112
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,680
and how does one make a success out of

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,680
potato farming

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,919
in bali yes potatoes in south africa is

115
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,199
planted

116
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,600
right through the season right room from

117
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,240
summer right through to winter there's

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,960
always somebody that plant potatoes and

119
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,520
somebody that always fresh potatoes so

120
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,160
we in a fortunate position that

121
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,800
you know there is certain areas in south

122
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:18,080
africa that they plant potatoes like in

123
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,400
the halting area western free state and

124
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,720
kozulu natal and they are in the western

125
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,680
cape okay you ask me what is the

126
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,840
important thing about potatoes say for

127
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,440
instance if you want to start with

128
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,400
potatoes

129
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,800
the first thing is that you have to do

130
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,960
your research

131
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,000
raw potatoes fit

132
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,800
into in that area is it suitable to

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,479
plant your potatoes in that area

134
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,720
is the soil suitable to plant potatoes

135
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,919
what is the

136
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,520
the pest and diseases that can attack

137
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,199
your potatoes

138
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,600
and lastly uh is also the end of the day

139
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,080
you have to send your final product to

140
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,160
the fresh produce market or to the

141
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,400
processors or

142
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,000
one of those markets so you have to

143
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,919
investigate

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,039
those markets

145
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,120
the

146
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,800
because the end of the day you have to

147
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,560
make money to

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,600
to to to produce uh to do plant potatoes

149
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,560
potatoes is very expensive that variant

150
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,319
from a hundred thousand rent eight

151
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,960
up to two hundred to two hundred and

152
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,919
fifty thousand run the hectare so it's

153
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,759
very very expensive so you can't afford

154
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,840
to make a mistake so my first

155
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,600
uh to answer your question first of all

156
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,720
do your own work

157
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,680
see if it will fit into your rotation

158
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,360
fit in your form and another thing is

159
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,560
with potatoes we always say you need

160
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,599
the

161
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,000
the the implements you need you have to

162
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,400
have a plant you have to have irrigation

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,039
you have to have a lifter you have to

164
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,280
have a sprayer and lastly you have to

165
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
have a sorting space where you can sort

166
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,160
your potatoes

167
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,280
so it is a high input cost

168
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,280
the second

169
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,280
do secondly i will say

170
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,039
start small

171
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,440
and grow into it so that if you

172
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,639
if you make a mistake it's on a smaller

173
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,639
scale

174
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,440
and you don't have a you know

175
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,080
you you you you manage your risk on a

176
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,759
smaller scale as we if you open the

177
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,039
gates and you start and you plant big

178
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,880
hectares

179
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,520
you know the risk is just too high and

180
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,080
your input cost is very very high in

181
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,240
potatoes yes and then there's quite a

182
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,039
few things other that you can make use

183
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,400
of

184
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,599
this a lot of expertise in the field

185
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
um

186
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,120
you know your

187
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,520
your distribution companies that

188
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,360
distribute chemicals and

189
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,759
and fertilizers and so on they have very

190
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,360
knowledgeable people in the specific

191
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,199
areas that will

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,639
guide you

193
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,039
to

194
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,639
make a success if you want to start the

195
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,639
plant potatoes

196
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,080
another thing is what a potato grower

197
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,199
mistake in consideration is remember you

198
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,639
plant seed potatoes and that is a tuber

199
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,400
that is produced by a seed grower

200
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,360
and always buy

201
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,319
certified seed because there is a

202
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,519
guarantee on certified seed

203
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,919
uh that you also as part of your whole

204
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,959
process of manage

205
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,200
risk

206
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,640
uh at the end of the day

207
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,800
okay and then lastly is potatoes is

208
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,360
economical of scale

209
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,880
you have to have a high yield

210
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,279
a high youth

211
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,080
and high quality of potatoes

212
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,360
market at the right time at the right

213
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,120
market to get the right at the the best

214
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,519
uh price for your or for your potatoes

215
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,360
these are it sounds very technical you

216
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,920
know everything that you're saying about

217
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,399
um yes your advice is to say start small

218
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,880
so that you know when you do fail at

219
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,160
least you don't lose as much in your

220
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,680
investment as opposed to going big um

221
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,399
and i like how you just mentioned the

222
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,160
technicalities around sprouting around

223
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,959
the fact that we also need to farm

224
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,040
potatoes with irrigation because you

225
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,560
know without water farming does become a

226
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,240
little bit tricky especially with high

227
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,800
value crops such as potatoes so you know

228
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,920
we've had a lot of rains around december

229
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,080
january february period and um with with

230
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,720
your knowledge and and maybe uh the

231
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,959
farmers that you've worked with how have

232
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,320
they um mitigated the risks or still

233
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:53,120
kept their farm businesses in survival

234
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,240
mode rather in survival mode with all

235
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,920
these climate change um

236
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,000
different variables happening in various

237
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,000
parts of the provinces in the country

238
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,200
molly yes um

239
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,959
the the potato farmer uh he must watch

240
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,720
the weather

241
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:19,519
because potatoes is very acceptable in

242
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:22,240
chains of weather patterns

243
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,920
and if you just look at the spray

244
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,800
program and if you see there is a coat

245
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,560
from coming in of a lot of rain

246
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,120
you must

247
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,079
spray preventative

248
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,320
for

249
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,920
certain diseases

250
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,120
and my advice to a farmer is

251
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,600
do not wait until the disease or the

252
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,760
pest is on the farm

253
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,480
create or develop a spray pro program

254
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,640
that is preventative

255
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,200
a good measurement is

256
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,079
what you do before flowering determines

257
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,920
your

258
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:05,839
your success hour after flowering so yes

259
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,040
okay in bayern we have quite a

260
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,680
we have a very nice portfolio to a

261
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,640
microvision for all the

262
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,839
different pests and diseases that you

263
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,320
can

264
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,399
pick up during the growing season if i

265
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,440
can just start at uh

266
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,760
when you plant it at planting

267
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,600
there's a big problem with two

268
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,200
things that you must keep in mind first

269
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,480
of all is

270
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,440
nematodes

271
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,920
so we have a product with the name of

272
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,440
villam prime that control

273
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,320
nematodes

274
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,440
and the second one there is uh imester

275
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,560
solvers one of our new uh products that

276
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,680
we will launch we're busy launching it

277
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,720
and that cro

278
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,320
uh control raza

279
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,079
those two

280
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:59,279
uh products play a vital role in the

281
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,079
appearance of your potato that you want

282
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,279
to sell to the housewife

283
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,160
the potatoes as well research it after

284
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,959
products as well research

285
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,000
and if you use it according to the label

286
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,560
uh you will have good results okay so we

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,720
covered the the planting and what's

288
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,600
happening under the soil

289
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
and secondly when the potatoes start to

290
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,480
grow

291
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,720
then there's a fungus fungus diseases

292
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,279
that can attack your potatoes and there

293
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,200
is certain insects that can attack your

294
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:38,880
potatoes and therefore we have um a good

295
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,320
portfolio we have uh folic

296
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,920
nativo infinitu for the fungus

297
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,040
diseases and then we have dieses buddha

298
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,200
can belt to control your moth

299
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,360
diseases and there's other companies

300
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,920
that also supply

301
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,040
products to control

302
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,760
for instance leaf miner

303
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,160
we can't we can't supply everything to

304
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,440
them to the potato growers so you have

305
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,800
to make use of other companies that

306
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,120
that support a spraying program during

307
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,920
the season okay come back to your

308
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,399
original question about the weather and

309
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:24,160
and and so on yes weather is a critical

310
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,320
factor if you have too much rain

311
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,959
you your fertilizer

312
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,680
reach out and your blonde come under

313
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,320
stress and then they develop them

314
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,800
certain diseases and so on so you always

315
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,800
have to measure what happened with the

316
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,040
weather and what you're gonna do during

317
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,600
the growing season so if you look at the

318
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,000
growing season of potatoes it's anything

319
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
between

320
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,160
three ah four to five months that the

321
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,720
potatoes grow and you have to

322
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,240
make provision for your pests and your

323
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,880
diseases every seven to ten days you

324
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,560
have to spray and that's part of the

325
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,880
input cost

326
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,480
at the end of the day

327
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,240
okay

328
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,639
the weather

329
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,440
is also

330
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,399
important especially in the eastern free

331
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,920
state where there is quite a bit of uh

332
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:24,880
dryland uh plantings that uh taking

333
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:27,279
place so those farmers depend on rain

334
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,199
okay again they don't have irrigation

335
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,720
where you can just switch it on and say

336
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:36,160
there is water so the depend for water

337
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,680
that we blessed in south africa yes

338
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,480
that's a risk

339
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,600
so

340
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,199
my advice is to eastern free state

341
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,040
pharmacists

342
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,440
you know you form you know where your

343
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,079
best lens is and you know also what is

344
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,680
the water capacity in your land use them

345
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,079
for potatoes

346
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,519
due to the fact that you manage the risk

347
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,480
the whole time

348
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,800
yes

349
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,920
to conclude

350
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,360
from buyer we try

351
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,639
to advise our farmers to

352
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,000
look out

353
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:13,120
uh look at the weather and make a

354
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,959
management decision in connection with

355
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,279
the agents in the field to prevent

356
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,839
anything that can happen during that

357
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,880
time where the weather chains or you

358
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,320
have lots of rain or all those things so

359
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,120
yes

360
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,120
we try to advise our farmers to be

361
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,279
successful

362
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,639
fantastic and sticking on to that advice

363
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,880
andre

364
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,639
at the start of the production season do

365
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,040
you go out do you work with the farmers

366
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,519
to say this is how your soil analysis

367
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,079
looks like maybe instead of planting a

368
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,880
plant population of a hundred thousand

369
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,000
you need to maybe do 80 you know or

370
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,480
maybe go to 120 do you also assist the

371
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,440
farmers with the growing program around

372
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,240
pesticide management

373
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,240
yes

374
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,720
we in bayern we specialized in in crop

375
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,160
protection

376
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,720
there is

377
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,440
some other companies like your

378
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,160
fertilizer companies that do the soil

379
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,600
analysis and then they recommend the

380
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,240
correct fertilizer and blend and

381
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,800
and and so on for the farmer

382
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,279
uh then there's the seed companies that

383
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,839
advise the farmer which seat and which

384
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:32,639
cultivar to use and every area

385
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,480
let's call it a set of rules

386
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,120
where you know that you have to plant

387
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,000
your plant population have to be

388
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,040
that so many plants per year and then

389
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,560
you will

390
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,320
produce a a very high yield

391
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,880
from buyer's side

392
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,279
for us is that we

393
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,720
give a lot of training

394
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:58,079
for our agents in the field we empower

395
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,600
them with knowledge and we give them

396
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,680
uh access to sell our products in the

397
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,880
field that they can

398
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,319
with the

399
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,839
hope of of the assistance of uh

400
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,640
of our area managers in in the different

401
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,439
areas that knows the area knows exactly

402
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,760
what to look then they developed a crop

403
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,240
protection program

404
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,640
for the farmer but it is not cast in

405
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,640
stone remember what i said about the

406
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,520
weather so you have

407
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,360
you have something that you can work on

408
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,640
but you can change your indecision as a

409
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,280
certain

410
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,600
problems arise and and you have to make

411
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,080
provision for certain things

412
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,720
and that's the role of buyer in the

413
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,799
production of potatoes

414
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,880
yeah tell me andre do you guys work with

415
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,280
industry associations because as you're

416
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,840
talking i also was reminded that oh

417
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,160
there's a potato south africa uh

418
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,480
association do you work with the the

419
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,559
industry association maybe to bring in

420
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,440
um maybe with your partners like the sea

421
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,400
partners good varieties do you guys

422
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,640
engage with the association to say these

423
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
are the right pesticides you know for

424
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,559
the season maybe from your research and

425
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,120
development because i know that

426
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,000
organizations like yourselves pride

427
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,840
themselves with the quality of inputs

428
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,400
that you sell out to the market so my

429
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,280
question is do you work with industry

430
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,919
associations like potato south africa to

431
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,679
give them expert advice on how to

432
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,679
successfully grow this commodity

433
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,360
bali yes potato south africa and potato

434
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,000
certification

435
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,679
services is a very very important

436
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,559
partner for us due to the fact that

437
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,360
we

438
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,440
use their plot platforms

439
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,520
to

440
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,880
introduce new

441
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,160
innovation

442
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,240
innovation

443
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:02,480
we introduce our new chemistry we

444
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,840
communicate with uh our farmers uh

445
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,799
but we

446
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,120
um

447
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,000
we in a partnership that we use their

448
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,039
platform or we sponsor platforms that we

449
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,360
can

450
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,440
can communicate to our

451
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,640
farmers out there

452
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,120
another important part is what potato

453
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,799
certification and potatoes at africa

454
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,720
play is that

455
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,160
they have

456
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,720
information available and as a strategic

457
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,720
manager for me is important to

458
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,480
if you don't measure you can't manage

459
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,280
you know so we use

460
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,360
the

461
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,919
the platforms where i publicized on on

462
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,880
on patellar south africa where a website

463
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,760
or certification website we use those

464
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,520
information to manage um

465
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,240
in south africa

466
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,280
you asked me about seed

467
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,080
potato seeds we don't have anything to

468
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,160
do with potato seed in south africa

469
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,559
these other companies

470
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,000
that specialized in that

471
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,320
um

472
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,320
one thing that the

473
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,919
potatoes at africa have

474
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,039
certain work groups in different areas

475
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,600
and we

476
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,000
use those work groups

477
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,960
to demonstrate

478
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,200
cypher instance a buyer product or by a

479
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,039
spray program or

480
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,960
new innovation

481
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:32,000
and the information that we gather on

482
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,720
on on on workgroup level

483
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
is fantastic for a farmer because it's

484
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:42,320
information that he can use

485
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,440
in his area and he gets specific answers

486
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,760
for his problem and he can

487
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,559
manage risk with those information that

488
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,000
we

489
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,240
we we

490
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,080
collect

491
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,799
in in this

492
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,080
this is not a strange relationship but

493
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,159
everybody

494
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,760
make use of this

495
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,760
those platforms and work groups to

496
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,679
communicate with our client the end of

497
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:12,559
the day and uh client is our farmers

498
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,159
absolutely absolutely as i let go of you

499
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,480
andre i think you've just you know

500
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,440
unpacked this specific commodity quite

501
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,919
technically um and it's not a it's not

502
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,720
it's not a conversation we have every

503
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,880
single day and you've literally

504
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,400
displayed the intricacies around potato

505
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,360
farming and i guess this is the reason

506
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,559
why there's not so many players farming

507
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,960
potatoes because yes it is a big staple

508
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,200
crop it's a very important one around

509
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,000
the south african landscape but also

510
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,559
it's very difficult to master so maybe

511
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,960
leave us with a fun fact you know um

512
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,360

513
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,360
big uh do you know any big potato

514
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,960
farmers in south africa you don't have

515
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,520
to mention their names but maybe just

516
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,240
give us a fun fact of the biggest potato

517
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,799
producer is producing one how many uh

that is uh

522
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,080
yes

for for for consumers around the country

576
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,480

579
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,840
farming mind

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,799
thank you molly i really appreciate it

581
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:42,240
and i really enjoyed talking to you

582
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,640
likewise that was andrei dutoy

583
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,039
the go-to market manager from bayer

584
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,799
crops crop division and we were

585
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,679
discussing and maybe slightly unpacking

586
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,720
down the potato industry basically um

587
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,400
getting to know from his uh um advice

588
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,720
how many hectares one should start with

589
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,640
and he mentioned also besides land it's

590
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,120
cricket it's critical to have the right

591
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,320
equipment the right mechanization to be

592
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,159
able to plant your potatoes um weed uh

593
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,799
the areas around your potatoes and more

594
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,559
and more importantly harvest the

595
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,760
potatoes because it's quite a delicate

596
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:18,240
crop it needs special care and attention

597
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,039
and he mentioned that the rough or

598
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,880
average um input cost per hectare is

599
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,240
about a hundred thousand and it can all

600
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,240
go all the way about about up to 200 000

601
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,520
per hectare so you have to make sure
