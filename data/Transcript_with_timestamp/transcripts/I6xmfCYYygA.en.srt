00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,240
rice a simple word yet it represents

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,960
sustenance for billions across our

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,679
planet from the bustling streets of

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,120
Bangkok to the Tranquil Countryside of

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,240
Vietnam rice is more than just a food

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,680
it's a way of life but how often do we

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,359
pause to consider the Journey of this

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,400
humble grain join me now as we delve

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,720
into the fascinating world of rice

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,920
cultivation we'll uncover the secrets of

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,640
this aquatic crop from its submerged

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
Beginnings to the golden waves of

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,640
harvest

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,840
our journey commences in the heart of

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,079
rice country where the land sculpted

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,200
over centuries lies ready to receive its

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,000
most precious offering the rice seed but

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,879
before a single grain can be sewn the

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,399
stage must be meticulously set Farmers

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,480
with an innate understanding of their

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,879
land begin the laborious task of

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,440
preparing the fields the soil rich and

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,840
fertile from generations of rice

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,879
cultivation is first carefully plowed

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,320
transforming the earth into a canvas of

00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,079
ensuring an even distribution of water a

28
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,320
crucial element in the life of a rice

29
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,360

flooded Fields with the stage set the

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,119
planting begins some Farmers scatter

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,320
seeds directly onto the water's surface

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,040
a method known as direct seeding others

36
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,840
opting for a more controlled approach

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
carefully transplant young seedlings

38
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,040

00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,280
remarkable transformation takes place

106
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,599
the rice plants having reached maturity

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,760
begin to flower tiny delicate blooms

108
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,319
emerge their pale green Hues a stark

109
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,959
contrast to the vibrant green of the

110
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:55,480
leaves these flowers pollinated by the

111
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,680
wind and the insects that called The

112
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,280
Patty Fields home hold the key to the

113
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,239
next stage of the rice plant's life

114
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,400
cycle the formation of the grains slowly

115
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,200
almost imperceptibly at first the rice

116
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,319
grains begin to swell each grain a tiny

117
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,560
capsule of Life contains the potential

118
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,200
to nourish and sustain the farmer his

119
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,200
heart filled with pride watches as the

120
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,560
fields gradually transform from a sea of

121
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,639
green to a shimmering expanse of gold

122
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,280
the time for Harvest the culmination of

123
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,320
months of hard work and dedication is

124
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,440
finally at hand the air heavy with the

125
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,680
scent of ripe grain carries a sense of

126
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,800
anticipation for the farmer this is a

127
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,039
time of both celebration and relief a

128
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,440
time to reap the rewards of his labor in

129
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,280
many parts of the world the Harvest is

130
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,720
still a communal Affair a time for

131
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,960
families and neighbors to come together

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,680
and help bring in the crop the rhythmic

133
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,680
swishing of sickles cutting through the

134
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,520
stalks the laughter and chatter of the

135
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,320
Harvesters and the gentle rustling of

136
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,400
the rice plants create a symphony of

137
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,759
sound a testament to the enduring

138
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,840
connection between humanity and the land

139
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,120
the harvested rice stalks heavy with

140
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,039
golden grains are carefully gathered and

141
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,080
bundled ready for the next stage of

142
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:01,639
their Journey the transformation from

143
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,639
plant to

144
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,000
plate the Journey of rice however is far

145
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,880
from over harvested from the flooded

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,360
Fields the bundles of rice stalks now

147
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,080
embark on a new leg of their

148
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,919
transformation one that will see them

149
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,039
shed their outer layers and emerge as

150
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,840
the polished grains we recognize the

151
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,000
first stage of this process known as

152
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,440
threshing involves separating the rice

153
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,680
grains from the stalks traditionally

154
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,400
this was done by hand beating the stalks

155
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,880
against a hard surface to release the

156
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,639
grains today however machines have

157
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,319
largely taken over for this task

158
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,400
increasing efficiency while preserving

159
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,400
the Integrity of the grain freed from

160
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,240
their stocks the rice grains still

161
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,720
encased in their protective husks

162
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,919
undergo a process known as hulling here

163
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,680
large machines gently loosen the husks

164
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,759
allowing the brown rice grains within to

165
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,199
emerge these husks far from being

166
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,960
discarded are often used as animal feed

167
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,639
or as a source of fuel highlighting the

168
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,880
resourcefulness inherent in traditional

169
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,960
agricultural practices the brown rice

170
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,639
grains their outer layers removed are

171
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,160
now ready for the next stage of their

172
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,840
transformation Milling

173
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,479
this process involving a series of

174
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,000
rollers that gently rub against the

175
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,479
grains removes the bran layer revealing

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,639
the white rice within the brand rich in

177
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,520
nutrients and fiber is often saved and

178
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,319
sold separately a testament to the

179
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,599
growing awareness of the health benefits

180
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,919
of whole grains the white rice grains

181
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:20,960
now polished to a pearly Sheen undergo a

182
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,599
final inspection ensuring only the

183
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,240
highest quality grains make it to the

184
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,759
consumer sorted by size and quality the

185
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,280
rice is then packaged ready to be

186
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,160
shipped to markets and supermarkets

187
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,720
around the world the Journey from field

188
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,639
to package is a testament to human

189
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,280
Ingenuity and Innovation over centuries

190
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,720
