this

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,000
webinar on resilient drylands innovating

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,359
for sustainable agricultural landscape

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,840
and

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,840
livelihoods my name is y yasmi and I'm a

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,399
special coordinator

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,600
for the plan production and protection

12
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,480
division at

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,719
FAO it is really a great honor to see

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,680
many of you joining this webinar and I'm

15
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:48,360
pretty sure some will still join later

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:51,600
on um so it's encouraging to see you

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,680
know how uh the subject matters is

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,600
relevant for for all of us colleagues I

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,239
invite you also to introduce yourself in

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,159
chat room maybe where you are from so

21
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:07,960
that we know you know uh in term of

22
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,840
where you know where you are and and so

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,200
for so feel free to to write your name

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,520
and you know your country where you are

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,640
based so the drylands you know are very

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,159
important topics for FAO and for all of

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,000
us not only because of the significant

28
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,479
contribution to

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
agriculture but also for pecularities of

30
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:35,520
the of the drylands and a lot in know

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,600
pecularity of challenges that they are

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,399
facing so today we are so pleased to

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,079
have an opportunity to discuss this to

34
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:46,520
share lesson learned to share best

35
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,640
practices and also you know we look

36
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,600
forward to get your feedback and views

37
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,200
on how we can actually work on Dryland

38
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,520
better in the future to address the

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,840
issues of poverty food insecurity and

40
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,759
malnutrition

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,479
colleagues uh participants uh and and

42
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:11,840
Este team uh panels without further Ado

43
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:16,280
uh I would like to start this webinar by

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,480
inviting uh Miss Beth Beall FAO deputy

45
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,519
director General to give her welcoming

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,440
remark Beth offer to

47
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:29,280
you thanks very much Yi and to all of

48
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,280
our distinguished guests uh to all of

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,200
our colleagues Coles uh and um everyone

50
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,920
who is with us here today uh obviously

51
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,000
we are pulling from a very Global

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,000
audience so I need to say good morning

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,159
good afternoon and good evening uh to

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,599
each of you depending upon your

55
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,560
geographic location I do very much

56
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,480
appreciate everyone's taking the time to

57
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,920
join us today for I think this important

58
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,840
discussion Yi has already indicated that

59
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,599
uh drylands certainly have their own

60
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,599
unique uh

61
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,560
characteristics um and they are critical

62
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,440
to achieving Global Food security and so

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,560
drawing attention uh through today's

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,440
webinar on how we innovate for

65
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,720
sustainable agricultural Landscapes and

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,080
liih hoods I think is an incredibly

67
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,239
timely discussion I'm also really

68
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,920
pleased to see some familiar and

69
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,840
friendly faces here on the screen uh

70
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,400
Jackie Hughes uh here uh with us again

71
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,439
uh as our partner

72
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,879
uh errat uh and FAO have worked on many

73
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,519
things together over the years and with

74
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,439
her role as director General we have

75
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,120
very recently uh been able to take on a

76
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,519
number of these important types of

77
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,239
topics together but we are also joined

78
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,400
by a number of other distinguished

79
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,239
speakers uh from across many continents

80
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,159
uh I'm looking forward to hearing from

81
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,959
them uh hopefully meeting them in the

82
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,239
future as well because I know they will

83
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,680
enrich today's discussions uh each

84
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,120
bringing their own perspectives and

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,360
their unique knowledge I have I think

86
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,879
many ways the easy job uh of setting the

87
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,959
stage a little bit and then I get to

88
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,920
listen uh it's not often that I get to

89
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,840
sort of sit in the background and really

90
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,000
soak in the information and the

91
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,720
knowledge from so many of our partners

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,800
but let me try uh to do just a little

93
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,880
bit of of staging for today's uh webinar

94
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,840
discussion we I think all appreciate

95
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:37,000
that dry lands uh make up over 40% of

96
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,720
the earth's land surface they are home

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,120
to two billion people on the planet and

98
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,880
also Supply about 60% of the world's

99
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,720
food production making them a very

100
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,440
unique type of ecosystem but one that is

101
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,880
also characterized quite harshly by

102
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,759
water scarcity and low precipitation but

103
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,280
although these regions are dry they are

104
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:04,160
not barren they are productive

105
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,919
landscapes for plants and animals but

106
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,520
they certain they certainly require our

107
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:12,479
committed attention between climate

108
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,560
variability unsustainable land use

109
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,880
conflicts and demographic shifts we are

110
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,280
seeing the continued degradation of

111
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,280
these ecosystems and these are areas

112
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,120
that are facing unprecedented challenges

113
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,080
but at the same time hold enormous

114
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,680
potential they are sources for abundant

115
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,080
soil energy they do have a rich

116
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,680
biodiversity within them and there are

117
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,720
countless opportunities to enhance the

118
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,720
productivity and the resilience of

119
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,600
production systems focused on dry lands

120
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,000
and I think this where today's

121
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,759
discussion comes fully into play is

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,680
where innovation has an opportunity to

123
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,160
play a key role to tap into these

124
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,960
opportunities and Innovation can be the

125
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,840
accelerator for the needed change to

126
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,759
scale up best practices um and

127
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,440
ultimately to reach more of an impact

128
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:10,520
but an impact at scale FAO has a long

129
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,000
history of supporting sustainable

130
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,280
Dryland agriculture around the world we

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,120
have contributed to the great green wall

132
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,680
initiative in Africa to restore the

133
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,840
continent's degraded Landscapes we have

134
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,319
supported farmer field schools in Asia

135
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,039
to the drylands of meso America to

136
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,080
restore degraded drylands working to

137
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,360
increase crop productivity and

138
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,599
ultimately enhance community and

139
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,639
Landscape resilience across these

140
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:40,919
continents and we also have initiatives

141
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,840
such as the grazing with trees

142
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,360
initiative it integrates forestry and

143
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,120
agricultural practices to restore dry

144
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,039
lands while increasing local resilience

145
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,560
against disasters and climate hazards

146
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:58,879
and alongside uh unep we are leading the

147
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,280
UN decade of ecosystem restoration an

148
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,759
important opportunity to draw all of our

149
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,520
attention to protecting and Reviving

150
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,039
ecosystems all around the world and I

151
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,639
think it too being featured as a decade

152
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,599
gives us an opportunity to build a

153
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,400
stronger more broad-based Global

154
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,720
movement in support of dry lands and

155
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,840
other important ecosystems but we still

156
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,960
have more to do and I think that's where

157
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,000
a conversation and a discussion like the

158
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,400
one we're having today is so important

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,680
for our part uh here at FAO in just a

160
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,280
few days in fact starting next Monday we

161
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,319
will be meeting and convening in FAO

162
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,800
headquarters the 29th session of the FAO

163
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,680
committee on agriculture or for those of

164
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,599
you well familiar with fao's

165
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,759
nomenclature and acronyms we call it

166
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:54,680
coag uh coag is one of four technical

167
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,960
committees uh governing body process of

168
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,960
FAO that provides guidance on

169
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,599
agriculture related policies we view

170
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,639
Global issues and Trends and we advise

171
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:08,479
on emerging topics and I believe this

172
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,840
will also be an opportunity to continue

173
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,319
building on this discussion because in

174
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,159
fact it was back in

175
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,879
2020 uh at the 27th session of coag

176
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:22,479
where there was an endorsement by

177
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,639
members of fao's global program on

178
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,520
sustainable Dryland

179
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,159
agriculture demonstrating that dry lands

180
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,159
are indeed a priority so so I hope that

181
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,839
with today's discussion and with the

182
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,479
bringing together of many of our

183
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,479
partners bringing together our members

184
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,760
around these types of unique topics that

185
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,640
we can find ways to best use innovation

186
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,720
Technologies data and other sustainable

187
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,600
practices to really Elevate and make the

188
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,240
drylands ecosystems of the planet far

189
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,920
more resilient than they are today so

190
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,959
yuy with that I think I'll stop um I'll

191
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,399
turn it back over to you and look

192
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,560

207
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,399
for farmers and for the livelihood and

208
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,959
also for food security so thank you so

209
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:48,680
much Beth uh dear participants I see

210
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,079

for this discussion uh by a message from

219
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:21,079
a director of land and water division of

220
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,519
FAO Mr Lee Fang Lee who is unfortunately

221
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:26,440

223
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:33,560
messages for us so heo could you kindly

224
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,560
play the message from director Lee thank

225
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,079
you dear deputy director General um

226
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,720
backto distinguished guests dear

227
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,279
colleagues ladies and gentlemen I'm very

228
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,920
pleased to share a few Point

229
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,839
contributing contributing to the

230
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,160
discussion on resilient dry land at this

231
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,360
seminar you may recall that I report the

232
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,560
status of land and water resources for

233
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,399
food and agriculture 2021 concluded that

234
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,000
pressures on land and water resources

235
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,360
are pushing the ecosystems to their

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,760
productive limit compromising

237
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,680
agriculture production and intensifying

238
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:13,720
poverty and Mal nutrition in all regions

239
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:17,760
especially in the fragile Dryland areas

240
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,079
over 95% of food is produced on land and

241
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,279
begins with soils and water we need to

242
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,720
work together to produce more with less

243
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,920
and safe guard these resources for the

244
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,680
future desertification land degradation

245
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,639

246
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,560
food security and the livelihoods of

247
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,880
mils negatively affect food production

248
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,600
water and soil resources and increasing

249
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,760
carbon emission and vulnerability to

250
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,399
climate change estimates indicate that

251
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,320
humid induced land degradation affect at

252
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:55,480
least 1.6 billion hectares worldwide

253
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,360
impacting directly on 3.2 billion people

254
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,880
more than 60% of the human induced land

achieving land degradation neutrality

301
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,240
objectives land Tous security is

302
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,959
necessary to encourage people to invest

303
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,040
sustainably in their land to fight

304
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,279
desertification land degradation and

305
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,720
drought and it's crucial to achieve land

306
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:29,440
degradation neutrality supporting

307
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,199
countries in dry areas to increase their

308
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,639
resilience of livelihood and to reduce

309
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:37,680
the impacts on vulnerable communities is

310
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:41,959
at the heart of fa's mandate sustainable

311
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:45,079
land water use and management is key to

312
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:47,360
maintain and sustain food production and

313
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,560
has to be at the heart of any Agri food

314
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,480

316
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,079
planning responsible land governance and

317
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:58,279
land Tous security and Dr resilience are

318
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:01,560
of fundamental importance for achieving

319
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,839
food security SEC especially on the dry

320
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,320
in the dry

321
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:08,079
areas the restoration of degradated

322
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,920
agriculture land needs urgent urgent

323
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,199
political leadership massive investment

324
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,120
and concerted actions on the ground I

325
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:18,880
feel will continue work with the

326
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,120
countries and partners to combat

327
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,680
desertification and drought to achieve

328
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,120
food security and nutrition with that I

329
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:31,399
thank you very much for your attention

330
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,880
and I wish you a very prod Ive

331
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,560
discussion thank you very much Le Fang

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,759
for setting the stage and context of our

333
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,880
discussion today I will move on uh to

334
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,440
the next

335
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:48,040
speaker uh Miss Jackie Hughes the

336
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,680
director general of rrad Jackie will

337
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,319
share research and development

338
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,279
perspective with the title critical

339
00:15:53,319 --> 00:16:00,920
development and opportunity for Dryland

340
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,920
agriculture jaie over to you

341
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,319
thank you very much Yodi and good

342
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,920
evening good afternoon and good morning

343
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:11,399
ddg Beth and the many colleagues and

344
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,759
friends who have joined us on this

345
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:17,040
webinar I'm going to be talking about

346
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,959
where the dry lands are the main issues

347
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,079
the latest developments and

348
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,240
opportunities for the future which is

349
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:26,440
absolutely

350
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,319
critical next the

351
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,680
drylands yes thank you the drylands as

352
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:33,399
Beth said cover 40% of the Earth's

353
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,000
surface land

354
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:42,040
surface but the frightening fact is that

355
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:45,279
it's 66% of Africa 40% of Asia and 24%

356
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:50,199
of Europe are covered with dry lands

357
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:53,959
whether they are arid or semi arid

358
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:55,720
next although it is extremely dry and

359
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,319
it's very difficult to get sufficient

360
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,959
water you will see the agricultural

361
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:02,120
success

362
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:04,520
happens we have rainfed we have

363
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,880
Highlands lowlands irrigated but

364
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,640
agricultural success is predicated

365
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,439
around the successful management of

366
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,959
water resources to achieve sustainable

367
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:18,240
livestock crop livestock or crop crop

368
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:23,600
system

369
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:26,079
next they looking at all these issues um

370
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,400
productivity we have heat and drought we

371
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,000
have soil degradation we need inputs we

372
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,520
need fod and feed there are pests and

373
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,039
diseases we need

374
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,480
pollinators and an exceptional drought

375
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:42,559
can cause huge yield losses I mean a

376
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,320
truly exceptional drought 100% loss but

377
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:48,400
an exceptional drought will give you

378
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:51,000
about 70% loss of soybean maze wheat

379
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,280
rice and as we heard just now the dry

380
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,840
lands are

381
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:59,480
degraded and over a billion people in

382
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,679
more than a 100 countries are at risk

383
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,159
climate change and climatic events we're

384
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,760
all seeing them and we've got increased

385
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,640
warming we also have cooling the

386
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,080
rainfall climatic events changes in

387
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,679
atmospheric

388
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,960
CO2 and climate change is expected to

389
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,720
cause

390
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,120
approximately

391
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,640
250,000 additional deaths per year from

392
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,520
2030 to

393
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:30,039
2050 we must either mitigate or

394
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:32,720
adapt looking at markets Market linkages

395
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:35,960
in some of our arried areas are poor we

396
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,640
have asymmetrical access to information

397
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,320
we need digital tools

398
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,200
globalization

399
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,000
transportation in Colombia SMS weather

400
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,559
Information Services reduce crop losses

401
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,080
by 11 to

402
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:54,120
14% every incremental increase in

403
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,880
production and harvest is

404
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,320
important we have Labor and civil

405
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,360
unrest we've got aging farming

406
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,080
communities agriculture isn't a

407
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,600
preferred occupation anymore prohibitive

408
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,840
labor cost gender related labor issues

409
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,760
civil

410
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,039
unrest and in my point of view the first

411
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,320
real climate change conflict took place

412
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,679
in the Sahel in 2003 when the war in

413
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,440
darur exposed how the convergence of

414
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,520
environmental and political factors can

415
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,280
lead to

416
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,280
conflict policies got to be adapted to

417
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,559
local needs and when adopted they need

418
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,120
to facilitate resilience and

419
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:38,679
productivity must be fit for purpose and

420
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:42,200
you've got to manage

421
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:44,720
tradeoffs capacity development has to be

422
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,720
properly determined correctly

423
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,320
implemented and you have to address the

424
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,440
needs of the different segments of

425
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,000
communities the farmers the production

426
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,280
systems because communities with lower

427
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,960
levels of adaptive capacity experience

428
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,280
higher climate imp climate impacts due

429
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,799
to their reduced ability to cope with

430
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,240
climate

431
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,640
change

432
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,600
next there have been developments it's

433
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:16,240
not all a bad set of stories here but

434
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,000
the landscape approach we need to be

435
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:23,520
holistic looking at watersheds

436
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,520
perhaps we've got to have drought heat

437
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,919
tolerant varieties that will survive and

438
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,679
yield we've had a greater Focus on the

439
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,280
dry lands think thanks to the

440
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,799
international year of millets and then

441
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,480
the G20 in

442
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,360
India but we have to continue that was

443
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,280
just the

444
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,440
beginning we need the crops to be

445
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,000
nutritious biofortified crops

446
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,600
exist sometimes there's enough food but

447
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,320
it's not good

448
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,280
nutrition we're harvesting water is the

449
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,840
dry lands and More than 70% of the area

450
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,840
of the Indian semary Tropics has high to

451
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,520
medium potential for implementing

452
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,640
rainwater harvesting but we don't always

453
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,600
do

454
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,000
it for our soil we've been putting in a

455
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,080
lot of inputs but not in the dry lands

456
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,520
and one siiz solution such as

457
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,440
regenerative agriculture it doesn't fit

458
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,919
all glass houses and hydroponics are a

459
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,520
possibility for the high value crops

460
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:26,400
which can be grown in dry lands um you

461
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,279
see them growing in the deserts of Saudi

462
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,720
Arabia so on protected cultivation but

463
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:37,880
high value crops

464
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,919
next We Now understand better physiology

465
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,640
and productivity we know about root

466
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,760
architecture for example and canopy

467
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,799
structure we know that if we get

468
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,480
increased light penetration to lower

469
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,640
canopy we can increase yields by up to

470
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,360
177% in some

471
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,960
crops we've got to minimize risk to

472
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,240
Farmers by

473
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,000
diversifying we need to use digital

474
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,679
tag but the information has to be not

475
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,799
only available it has to be

476
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,720
transparent and when we use machine

477
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,880
learning we have to make sure that what

478
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,200
is produced by us is correct usable fit

479
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,520
for

480
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,240
purpose we need to facilitate

481
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,159
breeding whether it's um through

482
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,600
genomics or other molecular tools we

483
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,360
know how to do it but the policies and

484
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,559
the regulatory EnV environment is not

485
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,760
always supportive speed breeding Works

486
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:38,559
conventional breeding six Generations a

487
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,200
year for some crops now so that helps

488
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,200
and we know we need

489
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,880
Partnerships but we need better

490
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,400
Partnerships stronger sustainable

491
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,799
Partnerships

492
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,960
next because I put it to you even

493
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:55,640
however hard we try are we going to be

494
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,880
able to meet the goals that we have set

495
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,200
ourselves and the figures that we're

496
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,679
seeing it's not looking good

497
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,760
particularly for the dry lands

498
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,440
next there are opportunities though this

499
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,039
is the great part

500
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,279
um one of the things we need though is

501
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:17,640
increased funding that is critical for

502
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,840
research agriculture doesn't get enough

503
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,960
funding to start with compared to

504
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,760
example medicine but we need more for

505
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:31,120
the dry lands I'll come on to the health

506
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,480
and nutrition aspect but for soils we'll

507
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,559
hear more about

508
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:39,240
soils but Farmers always overestimate

509
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,360
the sizes of their Farms they've been

510
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,559
putting too much on their Farms when

511
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,480
they could afford or even find the input

512
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:50,720
let's make sure that we target the

513
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,279
recommendations very

514
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,760
carefully

515
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:59,320
um the diagnostic tools that we have for

516
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,679
targeted advisories

517
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:05,760
we we can do things like

518
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,960
traceability um using machine learning

519
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,360
we can add valued

520
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,440
products uh capacity development it

521
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,400
needs to be done not nationally but

522
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,480
globally Continental Regional because if

523
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,679
you're limited by a country or a

524
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,039
specific group of people the

525
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:30,720
interactions aren't there and you don't

526
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:34,000
get the full benefit of the capacity

527
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,440
development if we look at digital egg

528
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,240
there are so many

529
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,799
opportunities whether you're using

530
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,000
satellites drones or any other type of

531
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,440
Technology but it's got to be available

532
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,240
to everyone and the information has to

533
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,559
be

534
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,320
true

535
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:55,799
next I was talking about the holistic

536
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,480
approach to health nutrient-rich

537
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:59,880
food we're looking at soil microbi

538
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,240
biomes we're looking at plant

539
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,760
microbiomes gut microbiomes the

540
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,760
interactions and synergies using big

541
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,799
data we can use Ai and we need to

542
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,120
understand the relationships between

543
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,240
them that lead to Good Health when we

544
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,480
have bio fortified crops which I was

545
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,080
talking about earlier make sure that the

546
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,039
nutrients are

547
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,120
bioavailable they are not always we need

548
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:28,600
to know how to prepare the food um make

549
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:32,120
sure that even when we breed the plants

550
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:35,279
it will be a bio available

551
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,440
nutrient we need dietary diversity it's

552
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,000
a very simple thing have diversity on

553
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,399
your plate we've been talking about it

554
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,880
for years it's not happening how do we

555
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:48,480
do it and however much we do for one

556
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,480
Health we need also to minimize chronic

557
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,279
infections that prevent uptake of

558
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,600
nutrients we don't do it all together we

559
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:59,720
do it bit by bit we need to pull it all

560
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,360
together

561
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,919
if we could go on to the next slide

562
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,679
please I'm talking about Gene editing on

563
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:11,360
this this slide it's becoming more

564
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:13,360
popular in some countries for example

565
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,159
India there's a simple regulatory

566
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,520
environment for Gene edited crops not

567
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,000
transgenic crops and for intractable

568
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,480
problems Gene editing can solve

569
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,080
rancidity in PE millet flour might solve

570
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,880
a

571
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,120
toxins and if countries still cannot

572
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,399
accept Gene edited plants because

573
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,200
somebody might think it's scary at least

574
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:40,320
then we will know exactly what we're

575
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,120
looking for in gene banks in the

576
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,559
diversity of our crops to use

577
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,520
conventional breeding so don't write off

578
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:48,960
Gene

579
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,760
editing if you think the regulatory

580
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,799
environment won't permit it it's an

581
00:26:51,760 --> 00:27:00,600
amazing tool and we need to use it

582
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:04,320
quickly next other opportunities

583
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:07,200
include crop management big advances in

584
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,080
productivity are needed and we need to

585
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,720
get our options right we need to have

586
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,520
the management options absolutely spot

587
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,919
on I'll talk about

588
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:23,840
adaptation PES and diseases are really

589
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,840
um taking off with climate

590
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,640
change we can use remote sensing apps to

591
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,799
identify and TR track and control but it

592
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:35,080
needs to be done on a holistic level

593
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:38,240
just controlling one field is not good

594
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,960
enough you've got to control a landscape

595
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,919
to stop the spread of pests and

596
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,159
diseases we can

597
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:49,960
help uh increase availability of

598
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:53,679
nitrogen in the soil using biological

599
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:56,360
nitrification inhibition again

600
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,480
technology driven but it would

601
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:02,399
help we can and um Advocate the use of

602
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,000
new technologies Gene editing for

603
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,159
example but scientists are not the ones

604
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,880
to do that advocacy very well we don't

605
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:14,440
do it well we need others to help

606
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,200
support us and some of these crops used

607
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:21,000
for the dry lands have industrial

608
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,600
uses yes we want food we want nutrition

609
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,320
but money is also important so let's not

610
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,960
forget that and I believe we should

611
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,240
foster entrepreneurship opportun unities

612
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,360
that's a way of getting the youth back

613
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,480
in um and we can scale and deliver

614
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,799
impact which is what we're all

615
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:44,919
about next I mentioned crop adaptation

616
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:48,600
and selection I put it to you all that

617
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:51,399
we can no longer breed crops for today

618
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,960
we have to breed crops for maybe 10 to

619
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:56,080
15 years

620
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,399
ahead why are we forcing crops which

621
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,919
love a semi- temperate climate why are

622
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:02,799
we trying to breed them forcefully to

623
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,240
the

624
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:08,799
drylands the drylands are expanding as

625
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,360
the we reach the edges why not put in

626
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,519
crops that are adapted why give

627
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,919
ourselves such a huge headache trying to

628
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:19,120
adapt crops that don't like those

629
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,960
environments our crops need to be

630
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,679
tolerant of climatic events abiotic

631
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,480
stresses and broad-based resistance to

632
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:32,640
PES and diseases but we have to get it

633
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,640
all together one plant not a separate

634
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:38,120
trait

635
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,320
next and please can we work at a

636
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,559
landscape

637
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,720
approach we need Watershed level

638
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:49,679
approaches we need to manage water water

639
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,000
is owned it's used for irrigation

640
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,080
Fisheries for drinking and it's a cause

641
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,559
of

642
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,600
conflict we need to have the cereals the

643
00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:01,440
legumes the horiculture the trees

644
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:06,000
diversify the cropping system we have

645
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,799
the tools we need data is plentiful it's

646
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,240
available and there are many

647
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:13,399
opportunities we need effective policies

648
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,840
to though to be able to implement them

649
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:19,200
I've given you a whole mish mash of all

650
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,000
the things that are wrong and all the

651
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,519
ways that we could work together but we

652
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,640
have to work at

653
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:30,799
scale individual Farms won't fix the

654
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,480
problem it has to be on across scale so

655
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,799
I hope it's given you a taste and I'm

656
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,799
looking forward to hearing if anybody

657
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:40,320
has the solutions that we can take

658
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:43,519
further thank you very much

659
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,320
everyone jaie thank you very much for

660
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,159
this succinct but comprehensive

661
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,360
presentation from you a very well

662
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,720
received and I think very critical many

663
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,720
of what you said are very relevant if

664
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,639
not all uh and thanks you know Jackie

665
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,679
for really bring this important issues

666
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:05,039
new developments opportunities yes we

667
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:09,000
have challenges but as you said we need

668
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:11,519
to work at scale and at landscape level

669
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,200
thank you Jackie uh colleagues for those

670
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,760
of who you who have just joined you can

671
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,919
start now asking question in the Q&A

672
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:23,639
chat um we will continue to the next

673
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:27,399
presenters our own uh makiko taguchi

674
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:30,380
will be sharing uh our work on Dryland

675
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:32,880
from fa perspective makiko off to

676
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:36,240
[Music]

677
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,760
you thank you very much Yi hello

678
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,720
everyone my name is makiko taguchi I'm

679
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,240
an agricultural officer with the plant

680
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,159
production and protection Division I

681
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,760
hope you're seeing my slide

682
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:51,360
okay perfectly yes great so I have the

683
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,080
honor to to share briefly about what our

684
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,880
division plant production protection

685
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:59,840
division is doing in the drylands

686
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,840
alongside other partners

687
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,279
okay so the first um program that I want

688
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,039
to mention is the Dryland sustainable

689
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:15,200
Landscapes uh initiative uh IMPACT

690
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:16,880
Program which uh I think flows nicely

691
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,960
after what Jackie just mentioned that we

692
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,639
really need to work at the landscape

693
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,000
level so this IMPACT program is funded

694
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:28,080
by the Global Environmental facility and

695
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,760
led by FAO and has started in 2021 and

696
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:35,200
until

697
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:37,679
2026 let's see so the program is working

698
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,360
uh in various forms supporting 11

699
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,559
countries in Africa and Central Asia one

700
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,200
of the ways is through this sustainable

701
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,679
landscape production

702
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,320
framework which addresses common

703
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,799
management challenges and drylands

704
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,880
through an integrated multi sectoral

705
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:57,000
approach and then breaking silos for

706
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,039
greater impact by shifting from

707
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,039
fragmented interventions to a cohesive

708
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:04,760
model through farmer field schools and a

709
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,639
improving access to seeds through

710
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:11,399
community seed banks and um business

711
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:13,919
incubation through forest and farm

712
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:16,159
facility the other element is the

713
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,320
integrated landscape assessment

714
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:22,360
methodology as Jackie just mentioned

715
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:25,080
data is available so through this uh

716
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,480
methodology we bring together data from

717
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,279
geospatial information systems such as

718
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,399
Google

719
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:34,600
Earth and down to household level data

720
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:38,200
so that uh tailored uh evidence-based

721
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:41,720
interventions can be made and these are

722
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:45,320
are shared and Lessons Learned are are

723
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:49,200
shared through a regional um exchange

724
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:51,320
mechanisms and also uh through these

725
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,519
community of practices that are set up

726
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,120
who are dealing with the data but also

727
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,200
with the production framework and this

728
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,519
is all supported not only by our

729
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,440
division but of course with the Land and

730
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:07,559
Water Division that Mr Lee shared and

731
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,559
also uh the forestry

732
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:13,359
division going a little bit deeper into

733
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,879
the community seed bank element that our

734
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,200
seeds and genetic resources team is

735
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:22,960
supporting this element is supporting

736
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,960
six countries from the sadak

737
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:31,760
region in focusing on the miombo and the

738
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:35,839
mopan Woodlands area in subsaharan

739
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,800
Africa so this uh community seed banks

740
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:41,599
are set up to help mitigate the negative

741
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,200
effects of land degradation and to help

742
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,879
a regional approach through the regional

743
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,639
uh exchange mechanism like I

744
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,079
mentioned and

745
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:55,159
then creating a s a sustainable and

746
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,839
scalable action through the coordination

747
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:01,040
with the sadak plant genetic resources

748
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,800
Center and it is also supported by uh

749
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,440
International platforms such as the

750
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,160
inter in international Treaty of plant

751
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,760
genetic resources which is also hosted

752
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,440
by FAO and this work is really focusing

753
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,359
on diversification that Jackie had just

754
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,400
mentioned it's all it's about

755
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,599
availability of quality seed through the

756
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:26,079
Community Banks uh seed banks making uh

757
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,079
available the well adapted crops and

758
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,280
varieties that some of them might be

759
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,359
traditional but because of of lack of of

760
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,839
Investments they may have kind of

761
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,520
disappeared from the

762
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:41,160
cultures helping uh Farmers to diversify

763
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,040
cropping systems and overall to improve

764
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:47,440
productivity and to have a diverse and

765
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:50,319
balanced diet and help helping Farmers

766
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:56,040
participate in new value

767
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:57,640
chains so in in that Community Seedbank

768
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,079
initiative also supported the

769
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,839
International year of millets that we

770
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:05,720
celebrated last year that Jackie also

771
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:09,200
mentioned uh millets is a one of the or

772
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:12,160
group of crops that are are suited for

773
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,599
Dryland environments so throughout the

774
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,359
year we have celebrated not only just

775
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:20,880
these 15 types of millets uh but um

776
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:24,839
various millets even Beyond these to

777
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,640
really focus on the the the traditions

778
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,520
and the cultures and the Cuisines that

779
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,720
have supported communities all around

780
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,160
the

781
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:38,200
world and I am happy to inform you that

782
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:41,960
the final report has just been published

783
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,720
today so you can visit the final report

784
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,760
of the international year of millets in

785
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,599
the link that is provided in the chat

786
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,319
and in the slide that you

787
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:53,920
see I would also like to bring attention

788
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:55,920
to an FAO Carta International technical

789
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,960
cooporation Network on Cactus that I've

790
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,599
been working on for the last decade this

791
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,680
community is working on on really

792
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:08,000
bringing together research and

793
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,599
development in Cactus it's a crop Duna

794
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,720
species is the main species but not only

795
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:17,160
that this group focuses on originates in

796
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,960
Mexico but now it's grown in in all over

797
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:22,440
the world in the Dryland areas we

798
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:25,480
currently have n over 900 members in 79

799
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,280
countries and the the really uh

800
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,760
interesting thing about this crop is

801
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,000
that it's or groups of crops is that

802
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,079
they're very resilient of course they're

803
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,599
Cactus they they Thrive well in Dryland

804
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:40,599
areas and they are versatile they are

805
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,839
good for human consumption as the fruits

806
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:47,160
or the pads of salads or vegetables and

807
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:50,560
as for fod it's it's an increasing crop

808
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:54,319
that is um recognized as a good source

809
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:57,240
of fod and it is also a good source of

810
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:59,599
bioenergy is G gaining a lot of interest

811
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,640
around around the world and next year

812
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,880
we'll be working with our partners zarta

813
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,079
and others to support the international

814
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:11,560
Congress on cacti as food fod and other

815
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,880
uses in uh Spain so please uh let me

816
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,839
know if you are interested in this work

817
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,760
as

818
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:19,000
well and on top of this I would also

819
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,119
like to mention that we have been

820
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,880
working in support of the US state

821
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,720
department and the African Union on the

822
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,880
vision for adaptive crops and soils are

823
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,440
or know known as V for some of you and

824
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,640
this is an an initiative that brings

825
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,560
attention to indigenous and traditional

826
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,839
crops that we some of them we have just

827
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,640
mentioned Jackie and I that are more

828
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:45,079
adapted uh to the local environmental

829
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,640
conditions and nutritious that can be

830
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,400
more nutritious than other major staple

831
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,640
crops that are grown in in the countries

832
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:57,000
and they have they are tend to be more

833
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,560
climate uh resilient and also um better

834
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,760
adapt to land

835
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,400
degradation so as Jackie just mentioned

836
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:09,040
it is important that these uh um

837
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,880
neglected and underutilized species um

838
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,400
get the attention they need for research

839
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,920
and development as well as policy and

840
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:19,319
investment

841
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,319
attention thank you very much for your

842
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,640
attention thank you very much makiko uh

843
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,400
I can see the a lot of convergence

844
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,160
between what you presented and that of

845
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,920
Jackies it's good you know to see how

846
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:37,800
you know um uh we are working you know

847
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,760
at Country level at landscape level to

848
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,920
promote uh to promote the dry lands um

849
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,560
so for sure you know uh as jaie said and

850
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,560
also B said you know we need to be

851
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,319
working together on this you know I

852
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,160
already see you know from these two

853
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:57,119
presentation how important it it is for

854
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,520
us to compare notes and to move together

855
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,000
uh to support Dryland

856
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,760
agriculture uh thank you again makiko

857
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,079
now I would like to move on to our next

858
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,520
presenters who will present managing

859
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:13,040
soil health and plan nutrition in

860
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,839
Dryland ecosystem in subsaharan Africa

861
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:19,560
it is my honor to invite uh Sami zingore

862
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:25,160

partners joining us uh from um different

873
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:58,920
parts of uh the world it's a great

874
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:03,480
pleasure for me to be be part of this uh

875
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:07,640
very important and um timely discussion

876
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,359
on sustainable management of U uh

877
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,800
livelihoods and landscapes in the

878
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:17,160
drylands and I'm going to focus uh my

879
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,119
presentation today on issues related to

880
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,680
the intricate connection between soil

881
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:25,760
health and pl nutrition with the primary

882
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:28,960
focus in uh subsaharan

883
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:34,599
Africa uh I wanted to start by

884
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:36,720
illustrating the core um intricate uh

885
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:40,079
relationship between nutrient management

886
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,400
and some of the environmental and um

887
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,400
social and economic uh sustainability

888
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,680
challenges that uh we encounter in the

889
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:51,440
region at the Apex of uh the challenges

890
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:55,240
for agricultural sustainability in uh

891
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:59,400
Subs Africa is the law and inappropriate

892
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:02,800
nutrient application um southern Africa

893
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:06,839
currently has the lowest use of both

894
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:11,440
organic and um mineral fertilizers

895
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:14,079
resulting in um a soil Health crisis

896
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,079
that is associated with nutrient mining

897
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,960
with currently more than 30 cages of

898
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,000
nutrients being lost from agricultural

899
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,760
lands on the continent and there's also

900
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,440
the um parallel um challenges associated

901
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,640
with overgrazing that also deplete uh

902
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:32,440
the overall and nutrients in the system

903
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:36,400
over the long term this Cascades

904
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:39,200
into um land degradation uh which at

905
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,920
this point 65% of the crop land in the

906
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,400
African vland is actually uh considered

907
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,359
to be degraded uh resulting in major um

908
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,319
you know challenges and high risk for

909
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:53,160
non-responsive source that don't respond

910
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:55,200
to management and um this then is

911
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,119
associated with a whole host of other

912
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:02,200
environmental uh challenges including

913
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:05,760
um High emissions of carbon from and and

914
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:08,319
biodiversity losses mostly through area

915
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,359
expansion uh especially into vulnerable

916
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:15,000
drylands uh that then trigger a lot of

917
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:16,760
uh climate um you know change and

918
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,160
exacerbate the effect of climate change

919
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:23,280
as well and this then is uh expressed in

920
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,000
the major food uh and nutritional and

921
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,760
livelihood challenges that we find on

922
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,200
the continent so what I'm going to to

923
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,160
address today is to highlight the

924
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,079
importance then of building soil health

925
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,800
and systems resilience with a key focus

926
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:41,280
on addressing the core issue of plant

927
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,240
nutrition and um focusing on integrated

928
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,400
so fertility crop and water management

929
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,640
and then ensuring that this is done to

930
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,240
address climate change and then

931
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,640
also address uh the cor specific

932
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:59,800
Technologies due to the diversity of the

933
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:02,839
um system that we are working in in um

934
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,359
the um different parts of the continent

935
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:08,079
but we also need to pay attention to the

936
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:10,000
economic viability of uh the solutions

937
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,319
because in large Parts uh a lot of

938
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,880
technologies that work uh um you know

939
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,800
from a technical perspective are not

940
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,800
always providing the right solutions

941
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:22,280
that uh meet the socioeconomic uh

942
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,079
requirements of small holder

943
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:29,359
Farmers I wanted to

944
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:31,559
um provide an illustration here of um

945
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,200
studies that we've carried out in the

946
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:37,440
drylands in eastn southern Africa

947
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:40,200
looking at the impact of low input

948
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,720
systems on so carbon and so carbon is

949
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:47,440
used as a good indicator of so Health

950
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:50,240
due to its multiple functions uh for um

951
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,599
biological physical and uh chemical so

952
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,800
properties in a large part of the

953
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:57,640
systems under small holder low input

954
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,359
system so organic met decline finds very

955
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:04,559
rapidly in the initial years of

956
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:07,359
cultivation reaching um in about 10

957
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:12,400
years to less than 50% of the initial

958
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:14,760
sologic carbon uh stored in uh Native

959
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,920
um Woodlands or

960
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:20,280
grasslands and what is very striking is

961
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,000
that uh a large part of the carbon

962
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,680
losses which is also associated with

963
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,440
land degradation occur in the initial

964
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,920
years of cultivation and resulting in

965
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,680
very low crop productivity with yields

966
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,160
only in the range of 1 to 2 tons per

967
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:38,319
hect and land degradation results in

968
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,160
cells that respond very poorly to

969
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,760
management and this is a key challenge

970
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:46,119
was in large parts of the world soil

971
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:49,319
health issues are related to

972
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:53,079
intensification and overuse of uh um

973
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:55,920
pesticides and and and fertilizers it's

974
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:57,480
a compressing situation large parts of

975
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,760
the sou Africa where large part of the

976
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,400
land degradation is driven by low use of

977
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:09,160
nutrient inputs but what we also found

978
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:12,599
interesting is uh by investing in um n

979
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:15,760
Plant Nutrition uh by uh investing in

980
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:18,240
Balance fertilization with uh managing

981
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:21,599
prop procedures to improve sologic

982
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,839
carbon um in commercial farming systems

983
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,599
uh we observe that we could actually

984
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:28,760
double the Sol organic carbon in the

985
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:32,480
long term term and maintain much higher

986
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:35,000
yields highlighting the core value of

987
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,400
Plant Nutrition in improving so health

988
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,040
and also contributing to sustainable

989
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,400
Crop Production as

990
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:44,640
well then I just wanted to then

991
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,720
illustrate um some of the um processes

992
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,119
of land degradation and how they relate

993
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,280
to crop response and plant

994
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,760
nutrition um the degradation rest and

995
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,000
restoration trajectories associated with

996
00:46:54,760 --> 00:47:00,960
crop productivity happen in a sequential

997
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,720
process uh in large parts of the systems

998
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,119
uh early part of the degradation is

999
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,520
associated with nutrient losses and

1000
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:11,160
under such conditions in the a Zone we

1001
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,079
can actually improve crop productivity

1002
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,319
by focusing on PL nutrition as a key

1003
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,880
component of increasing cor productivity

1004
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,920
and by investing in Plant Nutrition we

1005
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,440
also produce the biomass that is needed

1006
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,040
to maintain I organic matter and soil

1007
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:30,119
Health but as de addition advances and

1008
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:34,640
you you have a chemical and biological

1009
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:36,359
degradation taking place then the um

1010
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,359
responsiveness of the cells are

1011
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:41,480
diminished and the rate of restoration

1012
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,079
is also diminished and in those systems

1013
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:47,119
a greater focus on Integrated Solutions

1014
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,280
becomes pertinent but under Advanced uh

1015
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:52,400
degradation conditions a way I want to

1016
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:55,440
highlight in the zone C uh this is where

1017
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,079
degradation is very severe and nutrition

1018
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,319
itself does not Sol solve the challenge

1019
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,800
because SS become low responsive to

1020
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:05,640
nutrient applications and under those

1021
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,520
conditions Soul Health Restoration

1022
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,880
becomes in the key entry point and this

1023
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,119
is where a large part of the efforts in

1024
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,680
regenerative agriculture and some of the

1025
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,440
nature based solutions that are needed

1026
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,880
first to rebuild soil Health before the

1027
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,680
source can respond to nutrient

1028
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,640
applications becomes the key entry point

1029
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,880
for reversing

1030
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,119
productivity then I just wanted to uh

1031
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,040
End by highlighting that we have been

1032
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:33,920
working in these conceptual Frameworks

1033
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,839
uh addressing the critical need of Plant

1034
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,319
Nutrition both in terms of mineral

1035
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,119
fertilizers and Organics to support the

1036
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:43,319
Continental Agricultural Development

1037
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:45,839
agenda and we are proud as a pni to have

1038
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:50,119
contributed in a leading role in the

1039
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:52,520
development of Africa Union um fertiliz

1040
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:54,520
and soul Health action plan which was

1041
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,839
endorsed by the African government at

1042
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,920
The Summit in Nairobi this year this

1043
00:48:56,839 --> 00:49:01,520
creates uh the priorities and set the

1044
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,760
priorities of the continent for

1045
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:07,160
sustainable soil Health uh and uh plan

1046
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,280
nutrition and crop productivity for the

1047
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,480
next decade it's a 10-year action plan

1048
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,920
and the action plan focuses on

1049
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,400
harnessing multi-stake order

1050
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,520
Partnerships and Investments for

1051
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,960
sustainable fertilizer and soul Health

1052
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:22,880
Management and four key intervention

1053
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:26,799
areas are covered in that action plan

1054
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,440
which um will direct uh Innovation and

1055
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:30,119
Investments uh through multiple

1056
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,200
Partnerships in addressing the

1057
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:33,960
challenges of so Health in the continent

1058
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,200
a large part of what I talked about

1059
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,040
today is in outcome three greater

1060
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,000
efficiency resilience and sustainable

1061
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:43,680
use of mineral and organic fertilizer

1062
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,960
inputs but this is done in the uh

1063
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,400
enabling environment of impr improved

1064
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,079
policies Investments finances and

1065
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,000
markets to ensure that access to the

1066
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,079
right Technologies is enabled and then

1067
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,599
also improved access and affordability

1068
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,720
of the organic and mineral fertilizers

1069
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:03,079
which overcomes one big barrier of

1070
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,000
access and affordability and then also

1071
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:07,680
we need to also pay attention to the

1072
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,680
institutional and human capacity uh

1073
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:14,319
development uh needs to be able to drive

1074
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:18,920
the Innovation and promote the scaling

1075
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:22,119
and um the um ad adoption of the uh

1076
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:24,680
blood nutrition strategies that are site

1077
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:27,440
specific crop specific but also fitting

1078
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:31,319
the social economic context of small

1079
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:34,520
orderer farmers I wanted to end this uh

1080
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:38,040
highlight of the Continental agenda and

1081
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:40,760
um we'll be pleased to further discuss

1082
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:42,839
uh some of the key specific Technologies

1083
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,799
um as we will have time for discussion

1084
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:48,079
later thank you very much thank you very

1085
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:50,440
much Shi for your very interesting

1086
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:53,119
presentations and I congratulate you for

1087
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:55,240

know I very much appreciate the

1098
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,839
opportunity to share our learnings with

1099
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:26,160
all of you today um so as you know the

1100
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:29,040
spread of mobile phones and you know new

1101
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,680
technology and data present huge

1102
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,119
opportunity to disseminate and deliver

1103
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,680
customized information to small holder

1104
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:37,839
farmers in real time in a way that's

1105
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,480
really

1106
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:42,359
unprecedented um and today you know I

1107
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,799
like to bring in implementers

1108
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:47,040
perspective to the discussion and and

1109
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:49,640
share you know how we have approached to

1110
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,880
take advantage of these Technologies uh

1111
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:56,359
visal you know digital tools um and

1112
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:59,160
share some of our experience um in India

1113
00:51:56,359 --> 00:51:59,160
next slide

1114
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,880
please um so I'll start with a quick

1115
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:07,079
introduction of precision development op

1116
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,040
pxd for those of you who aren't familiar

1117
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:12,040
with our work we are a nonprofit working

1118
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,319
with government and other partners to

1119
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:16,359
expand access to Innovations and

1120
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:19,160
informations that millions of farmers

1121
00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:21,400
can use to improve their livelihoods and

1122
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,160
digital agricultur advisory has been a

1123
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,799
core part of our work um so we work

1124
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,160
flexibly with different partners

1125
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:29,920
depending on the needs in each context

1126
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,680
so sometimes we take on the implemental

1127
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,240
role um designing and delivering

1128
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,000
customized information directly to

1129
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,839
smolder Farmers but we also work with

1130
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,720
Partners to make data driven

1131
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:44,000
improvements to already existing digal

1132
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:46,040
services or in some other settings we

1133
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,760
take on the advisory role for the

1134
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:52,040
government you know trying to integrate

1135
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:56,680
digital Technologies into agriculture

1136
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:58,559
extension next slide please

1137
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,960
and over the years you know we've really

1138
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,799
focused on building customized

1139
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,640
Information Services for small water

1140
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:08,920
Farmers that are sustainable at a very

1141
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:11,040
large scale um and our general approach

1142
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,559
is to combine farmer specific

1143
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,400
information and available agricultural

1144
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,760
data in a given context um and then we

1145
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,040
create localized and dynamic information

1146
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,720
that enables Farmers to optimize their

1147
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,079
agricultural decisions um for instance

1148
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,240
you know you might have a farmal

1149
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:29,520
location profile

1150
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,240
um and and so forth from Farmers that

1151
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,920
you're working with and then you might

1152
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,200
have agriculture data you know in a

1153
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,359
specific context some some sometimes you

1154
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,520
know so so Health Data there might be

1155
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:42,160
meta forecasts market prices and so

1156
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,200
forth um you know usually you don't have

1157
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,400
all of this data in place at the start

1158
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,240
and this is something that you build out

1159
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,200
as you interact more with farmers and

1160
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:54,920
learn about the context available

1161
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:57,079
data uh next slide

1162
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:00,520
please and then

1163
00:53:57,079 --> 00:54:02,559
one important element of of our work is

1164
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,559
really to kind of create this feedback

1165
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:08,079
loop that allows the service to iterate

1166
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:11,920
and improve over time and there are a

1167
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:14,200
few key elements to this uh first one is

1168
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,640
that we use behavior science and the

1169
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,760
human Center design approach to ensure

1170
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,520
that farmers we targeting find The

1171
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,400
Advisory messages relevant and

1172
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,000
actionable um especially with

1173
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:29,000
agricultural device or even things like

1174
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,640
weather forecasts messages can get quite

1175
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,760
Technical and hard to understand

1176
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,040
especially in short messages so this is

1177
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:38,599
something we pay a lot of attention

1178
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,920
to second we use experiments and other

1179
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:42,880
methods of data analysis to continuously

1180
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:46,040
tested design tweaks to increase

1181
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,400
engagement adoption and then third we

1182
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:51,400
set up every service with scaling

1183
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,319
partners of governments so that we can

1184
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,000
rapidly reach you know hundreds of

1185
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:57,480
thousands of farmers and keep the

1186
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,040
service free free to them and there's a

1187
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,680
sustainable path um and the scale of

1188
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,680
course you know also means that you gain

1189
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:08,960
kind of more data access and that allows

1190
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,640
you to learn faster and increase impact

1191
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,240
faster as

1192
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:16,000
well all right next slide

1193
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:18,440
please so now like how does all of this

1194
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,680
look like in action I'll take one

1195
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:24,200
example today uh from India work again

1196
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,319
so pxd is Flagship program which is

1197
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,680
called a microchip so this is a two

1198
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,799
two-way voice platform where Farmers

1199
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,880
receive customized agricultural device

1200
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:35,440
on their mobile phones as recorded

1201
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,520
messages and then they can also call in

1202
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,559
and record a question to get an answer

1203
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,359
from a government agronomist within you

1204
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:45,599
know 48 hours or you know two to three

1205
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:48,799
days um and in addition to agronomic

1206
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:52,039
advice you Farmers also receive realtime

1207
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:54,280
alerts uh on extreme weather event or

1208
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:57,079
you know local past conditions where the

1209
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:59,000
information was available

1210
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:01,039
the service was co-designed with the

1211
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,960
government of oresa and co-funded by the

1212
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:05,119
government and the Gates Foundation but

1213
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,400
the vision for sustainable model was

1214
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,960
very clear from the start among all

1215
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:13,079
stakeholders that pxd would you know

1216
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:15,520
first build and improve the service um

1217
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:17,319
and then you know that's again about

1218
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,280
Gathering farmer feedback tweaking

1219
00:56:17,319 --> 00:56:21,799
messages or creating a dashboard and

1220
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:25,319
other tools to help the government monor

1221
00:56:21,799 --> 00:56:27,839
usage over time right and then uh we

1222
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:30,599
transition the to the government fully

1223
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:32,559
after 5 years uh but this was all

1224
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:34,559
planned so when we handed over the

1225
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:38,400
service with nearly three million

1226
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:40,960
Farmers on the platform in 2022 we also

1227
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,200
handed over an operational team that was

1228
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,160
already familiar with the the flow and

1229
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:48,039
managing the service for a while and

1230
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,400
really I think the remarkable thing was

1231
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:52,319
you know the government was because

1232
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,880
about that planning and and kind of

1233
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,400
steps in place they were ready to take

1234
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,440
it and B with it after you know the

1235
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,920
transition they continue to expand the

1236
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:05,280
service and now it's reaching over six

1237
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:07,160
million Farmers covering think over 20

1238
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:11,319
value chains

1239
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:13,839
now next slide please and then in the

1240
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:16,200
process of this scaling of the service

1241
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:18,319
we also Incorporated a randomized

1242
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:21,240
evaluation to measure the impact of the

1243
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:23,200
service among rice Farmers today I'm

1244
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:26,559
just touching on a few preliminary

1245
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,680
findings and insights um so first

1246
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:31,559
looking at the usage we saw a fairly

1247
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:34,039
high and consistent engagement over two

1248
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:35,799
years and then second we see a

1249
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:38,559
significant increase in total RTE

1250
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:40,680
production in particular a large impact

1251
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,000
appears to be concentrated among farmers

1252
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:45,119
in areas hit by certain types of weather

1253
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,720
shocks so for example in the first year

1254
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,720
of the evaluation there was this

1255
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,440
concentrated heavy rainfall that

1256
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,119
submerged plants in the middle of the

1257
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:55,160
season the analysis seems to suggest

1258
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,960
that access to amak crushi substantially

1259
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:00,559
increased total production among those

1260
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,839
farmers and then very excitingly we also

1261
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,920
see a large reduction in the reported

1262
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:07,920
likelihood of CIA crop loss due to

1263
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,839
weather related events and this figure

1264
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,319
you know comes from actually the second

1265
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:15,440
year where the the the big shock was

1266
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:17,920
actually the scarcity of rainfall so you

1267
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,760
know this this part of the the geography

1268
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:24,000
they get both too much rain and too

1269
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:26,119
little rain and we seem to to see that

1270
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,760
the you know generally the evaluation s

1271
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:32,119
suggest that ad visory was helpful in

1272
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,440
Pharm coping with these different types

1273
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:35,960
of weather

1274
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,079
shocks um three Insight that you know I

1275
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,039
just want to quickly highlight first is

1276
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,280
that these results seem to suggest that

1277
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:44,799
there's there is a very large amount

1278
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,839
need for climate information for for

1279
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:50,599
small farmers to to cope with these

1280
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:52,280
weather related events second we know

1281
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:55,079
that different farmers face different

1282
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:57,240
shocks and constraints across seasons

1283
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:59,400
and who benefit from the service and by

1284
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:02,720
how much will likely change from season

1285
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:04,880
to season so we might see a large impact

1286
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:07,240
in only a small subset of farmers in a

1287
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,280
particular year but that doesn't mean

1288
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:11,680
that the sh advisory won't be helpful

1289
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,720
for other farmers in a different year so

1290
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,640
so I think that kind of changes the way

1291
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:19,039
we think about maybe impact measurement

1292
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:21,720
and and and so forth and then lastly I

1293
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:23,920
think to enable Farmers to improve their

1294
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:26,079
climate resilience we see a big

1295
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,599
opportunity again with all this new tech

1296
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,720
Technologies and data to improve our

1297
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:34,200
capabilities to identify the most

1298
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,480
relevant localized climate risks um in

1299
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:39,079
real

1300
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,079
time next slide

1301
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:44,520
please now I'll wrap wrap up with just a

1302
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:46,079
few thoughts on the replicability of

1303
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:49,599
these types of digital agricultural

1304
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:52,400
advisory services so first um you know

1305
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:54,640
one challenge we faced is the difficulty

1306
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,599
of aligning donors and the government

1307
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,319
interest at the same time so for

1308
00:59:56,599 --> 00:59:59,480
instance you know the government might

1309
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,760
Express

1310
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,280
enthusiasm um but it takes time to kind

1311
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,079
of identify finding opportunity um and

1312
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:07,440
and so forth so by then there may be

1313
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,079
changes in the government or the

1314
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,240
government may be busy with something

1315
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:14,720
else to kind of collaborate on a a

1316
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:17,200
proposal in a month um and and that you

1317
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:20,160
know I I think that we really find

1318
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,480
ourselves to to kind of find this big

1319
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:24,599
opportunities lost because of these

1320
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,640
challenges of aligning you know all the

1321
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:29,559
the stakeholders at the same

1322
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:31,160
time second once you do have an

1323
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:33,319
opportunity to set up a digital

1324
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,880
agricultural advisory service with the

1325
01:00:33,319 --> 01:00:38,079
government it's really important to

1326
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,160
integrate the service into the existing

1327
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,520
government

1328
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:43,880
infrastructure um you know this can

1329
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,440
enhance collaboration Buy in and

1330
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:48,960
knowledge transfer which is absolutely

1331
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:52,799
necessary to make the service

1332
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:55,319
sustainable and then third systems Data

1333
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:57,520
Systems data processes that can create a

1334
01:00:55,319 --> 01:01:00,559
feedback Lo a critical to maintaining

1335
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:03,119
the impact at scale as we scale and

1336
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:05,680
expand our Target farmer base we have to

1337
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:08,400
ensure that the content continues to be

1338
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:11,400
relevant for more diverse farmer needs

1339
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,240
and environments and this requires

1340
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,440
constant you know Farm feedback and

1341
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:17,160
interations and I think one way that we

1342
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,720
think about it is you know when we are

1343
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:22,880
setting up these feedback mechanisms we

1344
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:25,119
are reducing communication FRS between

1345
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,880
farmers and governments and scientists

1346
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:30,240
and in all the stat stakeholders and I

1347
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:32,680
think that's a really important piece um

1348
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:35,520
and then finally I think part of this

1349
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:37,559
creating an effective feedback system is

1350
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:40,240
about establishing a culture of

1351
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:42,640
experimentation and learning um I think

1352
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,960
the return to institutionalizing this

1353
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:47,319
type of feedback mechanisms and a

1354
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:50,359
culture of experimentation can generate

1355
01:01:47,319 --> 01:01:52,279
very large sustainable impact of course

1356
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:54,559
we haven't really figured out how to do

1357
01:01:52,279 --> 01:01:56,920
all of this uh and we are constantly

1358
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:59,119
learning and I'd love to hear from other

1359
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,640
panelists and the audience about you

1360
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,400

head sah Consulting a consulting firm

1384
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:15,440
focused on transforming the food and

1385
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,720
agriculture landscape across Africa and

1386
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,160
I'll be speaking uh on promoting

1387
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:21,520
entrepreneurship and Agri food

1388
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:26,240
Innovations in drylands focusing on

1389
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:28,720
Africa uh just to quickly um you know

1390
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,799
mentioned that I mean it's a reminder

1391
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:34,440
that Africa is not really endowed for

1392
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:36,559
agult excellence and uh we know why um

1393
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:39,440
about 50 to 70% of the population is

1394
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:42,200
involved in agriculture uh 80% of the

1395
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,559
food produced been produced by by

1396
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:47,680
Farmers small scale producers and we

1397
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:49,920
have about 60% of the world arable land

1398
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,799
um but of course we know uh some of the

1399
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,119
issues we're facing with Dryland

1400
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:55,920
Agriculture and you know uh the

1401
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:58,599
significance of Dryland agriculture on

1402
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:01,680
how to make to ensure that uh we make

1403
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:02,359
drand agriculture uh more resilient more

1404
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,039
more

1405
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:07,960
sustainable um I want to speak today

1406
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:10,559
highlighting three uh ways to three

1407
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:12,000
critical ways uh to promote

1408
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,079
entrepreneurship and agre food

1409
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,920
Innovations uh in drylands the first

1410
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:21,400
would be focused on uh empowering smmes

1411
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:24,359
uh in agriculture to build resilience

1412
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:27,599
against shocks of climate uh the second

1413
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:29,279
will be scaling up private sector

1414
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,319
engagements with with more the farmers

1415
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:32,400
and they thought will be promoting

1416
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:37,279
Market Le

1417
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:40,319
initiatives um we uh we are currently uh

1418
01:04:37,279 --> 01:04:42,799
implementing a program uh called the

1419
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:44,599
building resilience against climate

1420
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:48,400
climate and environmental shocks uh

1421
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:52,039
brace uh which basically is focused on

1422
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:56,720
uh intensive capacity development um to

1423
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:58,599
support AF African agult smmes uh to

1424
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,480
become aware of how the businesses are

1425
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:02,079
affected by climate change and you know

1426
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,079
enabling them to develop strategies to

1427
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:09,079
Mi mitigate them it's quite it's quite

1428
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:12,079
um um a very intensive program over

1429
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:14,440
1,200 smmes across 30 countries in

1430
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:17,400
Africa have been trained and we're

1431
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,559
beginning to see increased uh business

1432
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,279
efficiency of these agre businesses at

1433
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:23,720
least about 30% of them are beginning to

1434
01:05:21,279 --> 01:05:27,000
adopt clim smart agricultural

1435
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:31,720
practices um on the next slide I wanted

1436
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,359
to highlight um if some some of the um

1437
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,200
some of some some part of the data

1438
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:38,039
Diagnostics uh coming out of the

1439
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:42,079
training and really to say uh you can

1440
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:45,520
see how the knowledge of country level

1441
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:46,640
uh climate smart agriculture uh policies

1442
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,960
uh have

1443
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:51,559
increased to almost over 90% just uh

1444
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:54,160
from from the training

1445
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:56,960
activities as well as the knowledge of

1446
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,640
of climate smart ult approaches many of

1447
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,839
the participants actually didn't even

1448
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:04,680
know or were not aware of any uh climate

1449
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:06,880
smart agricultural practices pre predd

1450
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:10,079
trining and it's quite encouraging to

1451
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:12,720
see that and uh I can I can you know say

1452
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:15,680
that many of these train hagri smes are

1453
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,599
beginning to adopt uh various practices

1454
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:20,440
uh in their businesses uh in the

1455
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:22,640
drylands and just to before moving on on

1456
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:25,559
this slide to highlight that I think

1457
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,839
addressing climate shocks in drylands uh

1458
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:28,400
to start with increasing the knowledge

1459
01:06:26,839 --> 01:06:30,559
of the key value chain actors very

1460
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,319
important uh businesses or or small

1461
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:35,279
scale

1462
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:37,599
producers um moving on the second I want

1463
01:06:35,279 --> 01:06:39,359
to highlight here really is scaling

1464
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:42,480
private sector engagement with with

1465
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:43,760
small farmers and I think if we're going

1466
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,720
to promote

1467
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,000
entrepreneurship um you know promote

1468
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:50,520
Agri food Innovations in in drylands we

1469
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,559
need to encourage many of the private

1470
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:55,319
sector partners that are playing in that

1471
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:57,799
space um and there are quite a number of

1472
01:06:55,319 --> 01:07:00,400
uh unique innovative business models

1473
01:06:57,799 --> 01:07:02,720
that many private organizations have

1474
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:06,440
explored

1475
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:09,119
um explored you know ranging from uh

1476
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:11,880
informal engagement between

1477
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:14,599
entrepreneurs and smaller Farmers or

1478
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:16,599
intermediary uh where they sign foral

1479
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:19,359
you know contracts where we have former

1480
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:21,720
subcontracting of companies and and and

1481
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:24,240
aggregators farmer groups um you know to

1482
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:26,760
engage Farmers to to to to directly you

1483
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,799
know upake their produce all you know

1484
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:30,920
more centralized models or nucleus

1485
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:33,160
estate model where these companies are

1486
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:35,319
you know setting up farms and engaging

1487
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,079
Farmers there but the unique thing about

1488
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:40,480
these private sector engagement uh

1489
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:42,400
models is that uh many of the critical

1490
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,599
services that small scale producers

1491
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:48,279
require in Dryland uh come with these

1492
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:50,039
service provision models uh you know

1493
01:07:48,279 --> 01:07:52,440
providing sustainable ecosystem for the

1494
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:55,839
farmers uh providing access to input

1495
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:57,760
Services training uh ensuring effective

1496
01:07:55,839 --> 01:08:00,319
system providing mechanization support

1497
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,279
storage support and uh the the most

1498
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:05,839
important of all is know the fact that

1499
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:08,440
there is Market access and these models

1500
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:10,079
are are becoming more and more prominent

1501
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,559
on the continent especially in in

1502
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:16,040
drylands across sever Valley chains and

1503
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:18,839
I think one of the ways to encourage um

1504
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:21,759
you know Agri businesses um working in

1505
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:24,719
this in this space is to really support

1506
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:27,159
the scaling efforts uh in ensuring that

1507
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:29,600
many more value chains are reached and

1508
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:32,319
many more small scale producers are

1509
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:35,120
reached as well and of course more food

1510
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:36,400
is produced this U is something that I

1511
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:40,759
think is very

1512
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:43,159
important um the third uh initiative

1513
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:46,359
that I would highlight or way that I

1514
01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:48,640
think we need that we we can explore to

1515
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:52,040
uh promote entrepreneurship and hry food

1516
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,759
Innovation is by promoting Market Le

1517
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,159
initiatives and there are several of

1518
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,960
them but I I want to highlight

1519
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:00,279
one called the advancing local Dair

1520
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:03,640
development in Nigeria program that is

1521
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:07,400
currently being led by sah Consulting uh

1522
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:10,920
robust uh comp comp complex program uh

1523
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:13,759
leveraging ecosystem uh model or methods

1524
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:16,080
to address the issues within the da U

1525
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,880
sector in Nigeria but not just

1526
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:21,839
addressing issues within the da sector

1527
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:24,960
ensuring that uh we are uh you know

1528
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:28,560
creating or building more entrepreneur

1529
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:30,199
capacity within rural communities um in

1530
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,440
both Dairy and nir

1531
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:36,600
communities uh so far the housing

1532
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:38,520
program has uh been able to form about

1533
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:42,279
form Farmers into about

1534
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:46,000
2,600 67 s up groups uh you know formed

1535
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:48,159
into over 200 cooperatives now we have

1536
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,239
more than 11,000 women that are trained

1537
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:52,040
on different entrepreneur

1538
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:54,440
entrepreneurship uh you know business

1539
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:56,480
models ranging from know poetry go

1540
01:09:54,440 --> 01:10:00,360
raring vegetable

1541
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:02,560
cultivation uh soap making petroleum

1542
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,480
jelly and you can see some of the

1543
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,840
numbers there how these women have been

1544
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:10,040
able to and through collaboration with

1545
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:12,239
uh private sector uh Dairy processors

1546
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:15,280
have been able to sell me qu over 2

1547
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:18,640
million USD uh in the last uh three and

1548
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:21,320
a half years and uh within the program

1549
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:23,800
we've been able to also train more than

1550
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:26,840
200 Community Based entrepreneurs uh who

1551
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:31,400
are providing various you degree of

1552
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:33,840
services um as artificial technicians V

1553
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:36,480
Community Based Animal hband Service Pro

1554
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:39,159
service providers these I think um you

1555
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:41,280
know has created a unique uh business

1556
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:44,040
part business pathway within communities

1557
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:46,640
and you know helping Farmers to to uh

1558
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:49,640
really you know increase income uh just

1559
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:51,640
to highlight uh what that is looking

1560
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:54,199
like in terms of income diversification

1561
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:56,520
for women we can see uh some two women

1562
01:10:54,199 --> 01:11:00,640
groups here that I highlight

1563
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:03,120
um in both can and Adama Nigeria with

1564
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:06,159
income diversification training they

1565
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:08,320
beginning to really uh explore uh you

1566
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,480
know poltry businesses and we're

1567
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:12,040
beginning to see that these businesses

1568
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:14,239
are becoming sustainable because uh it's

1569
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:16,360
they've not just done it one off they

1570
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:19,560
continue to reinvest um you know their

1571
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:22,440
profit and plow plow back into uh

1572
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:25,320
actually doing more uh this for us

1573
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:27,600
believe a success story that um if we

1574
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:30,600
support these kind of initiatives uh we

1575
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:35,040
definitely can do more in dry lands the

1576
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:38,600
the other one is uh around uh nutrition

1577
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:42,560
uh education vegetable gardening and how

1578
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:44,360
uh training women uh and Men on the

1579
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,440
principles of diet diversity and

1580
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:49,639
supporting them to actually create

1581
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:51,239
Gardens have led to not just ensuring

1582
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:53,400
that they have food for their household

1583
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:55,679
but they also have uh vegetables to sell

1584
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:58,440
and they're making uh money at the

1585
01:11:55,679 --> 01:12:00,520
community level it also just shows that

1586
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:03,800
uh if we scale several Market Le

1587
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:06,280
initiatives like this one uh we have uh

1588
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:09,480
likely going to be able to achieve a lot

1589
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:11,560
more uh in you know encouraging

1590
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:14,440
entrepreneurship in in drylands and and

1591
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:17,480
ensuring food uh

1592
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:20,840
availability um it's this is my last

1593
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:22,960
slide I I just want to end by uh

1594
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,560
specifically highlighting some very

1595
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,760
practical steps that I think we need to

1596
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,679
consider in addition to those three

1597
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:31,400
initiatives I think we need to support

1598
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,760
Agri food entrepreneurs to scale

1599
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,920
successful private sector Le initiatives

1600
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:38,600
I talk about some backward integration

1601
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,560
models uh between private sector and and

1602
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:43,639
and and Farmers uh service provision

1603
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:45,480
models as well um we need to leverage

1604
01:12:43,639 --> 01:12:47,760
infrastructure to annest the Dryland

1605
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:49,360
some of the most important Dryland

1606
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,560
resources and I think I mean solar

1607
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:54,480
energy comes to mind uh uh I mean we can

1608
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,320
aness the power of solar energy in

1609
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,600
drylands to power Agriculture and power

1610
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,080
other sectors in Africa and I think that

1611
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,560
would definitely bring a lot more

1612
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:04,480
development to the into the drylands and

1613
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:09,120
I think we need to support the creation

1614
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:11,080
of um a Pan African policy platform for

1615
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:13,199
uh a coordinated voice on on how to

1616
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:16,199
develop drylands I think that's has

1617
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:18,159
become uh critical now more than ever

1618
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:19,760
before uh we need to empower

1619
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,560
entrepreneurs to build resilience

1620
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,679
against climate shocks um with the

1621
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:26,920
little we can achieve on brace I believe

1622
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:29,400
that with more uh education around

1623
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:31,800
climate and support I believe that many

1624
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:34,159
entrepreneurs would emerge from within

1625
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,960
the drylands and of course the the final

1626
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:39,040
the final one would be the creation of a

1627
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:41,080
knowledge sharing Hub I think data is

1628
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,880
extremely important and knowledge

1629
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,639
exchange information exchange is very

1630
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,920
critical for business decision making

1631
01:13:44,639 --> 01:13:49,639
and uh you know evidence program design

1632
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:52,880
and implementation um I I will stop

1633
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:56,360
there and um I'll wait for the question

1634
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:58,719
and answer session thank you so much

1635
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:02,159

01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,679
agriculture measures so to start with

1660
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,639
our presentation I will talk a little

1661
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:18,840
bit about the dry Corridor in Central

1662
01:15:15,639 --> 01:15:21,760
America which it covers 44% of Guatemala

1663
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:24,560
Honduras El Salvador in nicwa and as you

1664
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:28,360
can see we are located in El Salvador

1665
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:32,880
and the country is within the the region

1666
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:37,440
however the reima project is on

1667
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:40,639
108 districts H which were selected

1668
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:43,480
through ER those territories having high

1669
01:15:40,639 --> 01:15:45,440
and severe drought and communities

1670
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:48,360
within the dry Corridor are severely

1671
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:51,280
affected by climate change events ER

1672
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:53,960
mainly for long periods of drought

1673
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,480
followed by intense rains and also land

1674
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:58,560
degradation

1675
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:00,280
and we have talked also a another

1676
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,480
panelists have talked also about water

1677
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:05,080
scarcity in the region affecting crops

1678
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,440
animal production and human consumption

1679
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:08,159
unfortunately we still have un

1680
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:10,960
sustainable management practices in

1681
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:12,960
agricultural production which leads to

1682
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:16,040
an inadequate management of Natural

1683
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:20,760
Resources especially Soil and

1684
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:22,840
Water so under this context we have the

1685
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:25,480
upscaling climate resilient measures in

1686
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:28,679
the dry corridor agroecosystems of El

1687
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:31,639
Salvador better known as reima project

1688
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:33,639
which was formulated in 2018 and it is

1689
01:16:31,639 --> 01:16:35,560
financed by the green climate fund and

1690
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:39,199
the Salvadoran the Salvadorian

1691
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:44,120
government and FES for a total of

1692
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:45,760
$27.6 million the project aims to H

1693
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:48,320
increase the resilience of the

1694
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:52,320
livelihoods of the population living in

1695
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:55,480
the dry Corridor to climate change and

1696
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:58,600
this is align with the objective of the

1697
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:01,960
Global program on sustainable Dryland

1698
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:06,320
agriculture which aims to empower small

1699
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:09,199
scale producers by building

1700
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:13,239
technical ER capacities to protect

1701
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:16,159
natural resources under a changing

1702
01:17:13,239 --> 01:17:18,639
climate H the project has three main

1703
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:20,560
outputs the first one aims to improve

1704
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:23,520
the resilience of the livelihoods and

1705
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:26,080
production systems in Family Farms the

1706
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:29,719
second one h is more related with the

1707
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:32,719
restoration processes of critical areas

1708
01:17:29,719 --> 01:17:35,800
such as water recharge zones riparian

1709
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:38,239
zones buffer zones of natural protected

1710
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:40,440
areas in order to increase the

1711
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:43,760
resilience of flows of environmental

1712
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:46,239
services at landscape levels and finally

1713
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,440
we have output number three which aims

1714
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:49,679
to improve the governance and

1715
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:52,520
information flow in support of

1716
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:55,719
sustainability and scaling up basically

1717
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:59,320
this output is is the foundation of the

1718
01:17:55,719 --> 01:18:01,040
sustainability of outputs one and two

1719
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:04,800
but for today's presentation we will

1720
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:08,679
focus on output number one where we are

1721
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:11,320
applying an Innovative approach in terms

1722
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:14,679
of capacity building and Agricultural

1723
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:18,080
Extension methodology we are working

1724
01:18:14,679 --> 01:18:22,239
with Farmers field schools but using a

1725
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:24,400
figure of a community promoter who is a

1726
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:26,600
leader farmer within their communities

1727
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:30,080
and they are selected under certain

1728
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:33,000
criteria we have technical staff

1729
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:35,639
facilitating these farmer field schools

1730
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,719
with these Community promoters after

1731
01:18:35,639 --> 01:18:41,639
that H Community promoters replicate the

1732
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:44,440
knowledge with a group of farmers within

1733
01:18:41,639 --> 01:18:49,199
their communities in average each

1734
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:53,360
Community promoters have um 35 farmers

1735
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:55,440
and that's why as you can see by 2024 we

1736
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:59,040
have achieved more than 40

1737
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:03,480
6,000 Farmers already because I think

1738
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:05,960
that we all or mainly in in in the old

1739
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:08,239
countries we have a lack of Human

1740
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:12,000
Resources however we are creating

1741
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:15,199
capacities of these people H not just to

1742
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,760
building capacities but also to provide

1743
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:19,960
technical assistance within the farmers

1744
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:22,560
we have the participation of women Youth

1745
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:25,719
and Indigenous people and we have

1746
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:28,360
achieved already more than 41 ,000

1747
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:30,920
hectares where farmers are applying at

1748
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:33,000
least two sustainable

1749
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:35,840
practices so which are the key

1750
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,000
implemented strategies that we are

1751
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:40,000
implementing to transform Dryland

1752
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,800
agriculture where first of all we have

1753
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:46,520
the traditional knowledge we have a

1754
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:49,639
validation of the sustainable practices

1755
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:53,280
with indigenous peoples and other key

1756
01:19:49,639 --> 01:19:55,520
actors H and actually indigenous peoples

1757
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:57,840
were very happy that we were rescuing

1758
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:01,400
some of these practices as we will see

1759
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:04,719
they are not new and people stop doing

1760
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:07,920
them obviously for you the use of

1761
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:10,600
products or other technology that is not

1762
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:14,560
that are not environmentally friendly

1763
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:16,880
and but facilitates the work for them

1764
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,600
another important strategy is the

1765
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,080
governance and institutional

1766
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,400
strengthening and here we are working

1767
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:27,159
with uh local committees that are

1768
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:29,639
integrated by loal governments ngos a

1769
01:20:27,159 --> 01:20:33,520
community based organization among

1770
01:20:29,639 --> 01:20:35,920
another key actors and this is actually

1771
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,280
one of the things that have motivated

1772
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:40,719
producers to implement the practices as

1773
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:43,560
well because for example in some

1774
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:46,639
territories we have local governments

1775
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:49,719
supporting uh producers with additional

1776
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:53,040
inputs or technical assistance and at

1777
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:55,960
the same time local governments can

1778
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:58,920
comply with Environmental regulations

1779
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:02,280
within their territories for example

1780
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:04,040
with uh the not burning in the

1781
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:06,679
agricultural

1782
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:09,320
areas another important thing is

1783
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:12,199
technology and the use of digital tools

1784
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:14,880
Community promoters have compiled

1785
01:21:12,199 --> 01:21:18,600
Baseline information of producers on the

1786
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:20,760
ground using Cobo collect tool and they

1787
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,800
also have been following up the

1788
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:25,440
implementation of the practices of their

1789
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:28,520
group of farmers use

1790
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:30,000
this H tool as I said the capacity

1791
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:32,679
building through the farmer field

1792
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:36,520
schools it's an Innovative approach

1793
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:39,199
within the project and we are leaving a

1794
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:42,080
human capital in the territories not

1795
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:46,120
only for this initiative but for some of

1796
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:48,239
the future initiatives um in the country

1797
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:51,719
and even when capacity building is very

1798
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:54,920
important we cannot forget about

1799
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:58,040
technical assistance and this has been

1800
01:21:54,920 --> 01:22:00,760
also a key factor of success for the

1801
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:03,560
implementation of the practices because

1802
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:06,560
Farmers ER can have access to these

1803
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:08,840
service and they also are more motivated

1804
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:10,159
for the implementation of the

1805
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,080
sustainable

1806
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:16,159
measures so which are the sustainable

1807
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:19,520
agricultural practices as I may as I

1808
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:24,080
mentioned these are not new and we are

1809
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:27,639
working with no burning no tillage h

1810
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:30,320
stab management contourline planting

1811
01:22:27,639 --> 01:22:34,000

1812
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:37,679
infiltration pits H death barriers the

1813
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:41,320
establishment of f bank with varieties

1814
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:43,920
tolerant to droughts and floods and the

1815
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:46,840
production of organic fertilizers the

1816
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:49,400
establishment of Agro forestry and Silo

1817
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:52,080
pasture systems the use of local

1818
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:55,159
varieties that are resistant resilient

1819
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:56,880
to the conditions of the dry Corridor

1820
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:58,480
and the implementation of drip

1821
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,280
irrigation

1822
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:03,639
systems in some areas where water is

1823
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:06,880
available and even when we are not

1824
01:23:03,639 --> 01:23:10,320
working with the concept of keson wild

1825
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:14,480
systems all the activities we are

1826
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:18,040
promoting among the farmers ER include

1827
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:21,840
this important H element of a

1828
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:25,600
traditional knowledge H including also

1829
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:29,400
an integrated man management integr P

1830
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:32,360
management and the use of or of the

1831
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:37,080
biomass as a result of the pr of the

1832
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:37,880
trees ER to fertilize and and improve

1833
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:41,280
the

1834
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:44,560
soil and all these practices also we are

1835
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:46,880
using the exact tool H for the

1836
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:53,120
estimation of carbon sequestration and

1837
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:56,960
we already have a 590,000 tons of carbon

1838
01:23:53,120 --> 01:24:00,000
dioxide equ equivalent capture H at this

1839
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:03,560
time at this stage of the project that H

1840
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:06,719
is the 70% of the goal we have and this

1841
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:10,400
is directly linked to the soil

1842
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:14,600
conservations soil futility and moisture

1843
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:18,600
retention that um impacts and improve

1844
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:21,400
the productivity and livelihoods of uh

1845
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:25,760
our people and I think that this is very

1846
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:29,040
key because ER some of our producers

1847
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:31,440
obviously they they are aware about the

1848
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:35,040
about taking care of the resources but

1849
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:37,320
they also are ER experiencing by

1850
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:39,960
themselves the benefits of implementing

1851
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:42,320
these practices in the cost reductions

1852
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:46,440
and the Improvement of

1853
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:49,040
yields so to sum up I just want to

1854
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:51,320
mention that it is very important as

1855
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:54,960
other panelists have mentioned as well

1856
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:56,840
to H focus on an integrated approach

1857
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:59,000
it is very important to rescue the local

1858
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:02,040
knowledge including Innovative

1859
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:04,840
Technologies processes capacity building

1860
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:08,960
h technical assistance in order to reach

1861
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:11,280
a a better and and sustainable dryland

1862
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:14,400
farming thank you very

1863
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:17,320
much thank you very much Marcela for

1864
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:21,480
sharing fao's experience let's let's say

1865
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:23,480
you know how f is in action in this dry

1866
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:26,400
Corridor uh I think it's very

1867
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:30,639
interesting and I also link it back to

1868
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:33,480
what makiko Beth and uh uh jaie said you

1869
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:37,000
know action at scale I think through

1870
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:40,520
green climate fund although you know

1871
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:43,480
there is a sizable amount of funding uh

1872
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:46,280
but to increase it skill it really you

1873
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:48,800
know require government commitment and

1874
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:51,000
and other stakeholder commitment to

1875
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,000
support the dry Corridor program in the

1876
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,119
region where you are working so thank

1877
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,360
you very much for that and

1878
01:25:55,119 --> 01:26:01,679
Marcela colleagues now we have time a

1879
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:05,800
bit of time not much for answering

1880
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:08,320
questions that are not yet uh very you

1881
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:12,480
know answers that have been

1882
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:18,760
Q&A um in in in the chat and uh I can

1883
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:21,880
see that some of the uh uh panels me you

1884
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:24,679
know have have start answering these uh

1885
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:29,040
questions but not all of them but let me

1886
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:33,199
have a quick look on these um perhaps I

1887
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:36,679
can go to first to uh

1888
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:38,920
makiko um there is a question I think

1889
01:26:36,679 --> 01:26:43,159
from uh Mr Alex

1890
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:45,119
Narco uh who is the FAO represent

1891
01:26:43,159 --> 01:26:48,119
representative in

1892
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:50,440
Djibouti um he is asking about you know

1893
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:54,280
where to get the cuttings of cactus

1894
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:56,760
because jouti is also dry uh if you can

1895
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:59,920
attempt to that question quickly makiko

1896
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:02,320
over to you thank you very much Yi I I

1897
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:04,280
think I just as answered that question

1898
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:07,480
in the chat too but just quickly

1899
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:10,159
answering that um Cactus does exist

1900
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:13,000
already in the country so first and

1901
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:15,280
foremost way is to best make use of the

1902
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,440
the species that are available Thea

1903
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:22,360
species but uh the cactus net can also

1904
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:26,239
uh facilitate uh different uh uh

1905
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:29,360
genetic resources to be shared from uh G

1906
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:32,280
Banks and other um entities uh through

1907
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:33,679
appropriate means uh so please contact

1908
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,560
me for

1909
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:39,679
further information thank you thank you

1910
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:41,639
makiko and Alex this is an internal

1911
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:44,400
discussion that you will not you will

1912
01:27:41,639 --> 01:27:48,199
need to follow up with makiko now we

1913
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:50,480
have this question from Sergio Torres

1914
01:27:48,199 --> 01:27:52,800
what is the percentage of small holders

1915
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:56,080
that could have access to digital

1916
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:59,320
agriculture or given data that is

1917
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:01,639
understandable to all uh and not

1918
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:05,040
dependent on the international or

1919
01:28:01,639 --> 01:28:06,920
government cooperation perhaps tomoko

1920
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:10,639
you can shed some light on this if you

1921
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:10,639
have uh you know any

1922
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:19,920
idea um I that's that's a you know very

1923
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,600
difficult question I think you know one

1924
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,880
is that like I think there are a lot of

1925
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:26,480
different you know stakeholders ERS and

1926
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,960
different digital an programs and you

1927
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,960
know they're working with it at

1928
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:32,239
different

1929
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:33,920
scales um you know in theory I think

1930
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:36,520
there

1931
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:39,040
are like I think there are different

1932
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:41,040
ways of reaching Farmers one is directly

1933
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:42,520
trying to reach Farmers through their

1934
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:44,199
mobile phones but I think there are a

1935
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:46,920
lot of programs that are also just

1936
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:48,960
leveraging you know availability of

1937
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:51,080
mobile mobile phones in the community so

1938
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:53,000
you can go through extension workers if

1939
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:54,679
you you know provide more real time

1940
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,800
information through extension workers

1941
01:28:54,679 --> 01:28:58,520
you may be able to reach farmers who

1942
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:02,400
don't actually have a mobile phone

1943
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:05,080
access or or in remote areas um you know

1944
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:07,239
perhaps Agro dealers and there are other

1945
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:09,800
kind of leader farmers and other points

1946
01:29:07,239 --> 01:29:12,239
of contact within communities that that

1947
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:13,239
you can Target in order to increase

1948
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:16,320
access to

1949
01:29:13,239 --> 01:29:18,159
information indirectly as well um so I

1950
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:20,480
don't have a specific percent number

1951
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:21,600
that I can you know I can share but I

1952
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:24,360
think

1953
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:26,280
that the probably the the proportion is

1954
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:30,520
very very high at this

1955
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:33,320
point okay is there any uh uh panel

1956
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:35,520
members who want to add to that I think

1957
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:38,159
it also depends on the context you know

1958
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:41,760
and and condition in different countries

1959
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:46,080
right any any of you want to add to

1960
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:51,719
that I don't see any uh hand from the

1961
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:51,719
panels um I also

1962
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:59,600
uh see quite a few of other

1963
01:29:56,360 --> 01:30:02,440
question um for example you know Derek

1964
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:05,159
makiko please how can we find

1965
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:07,360
you okay very interesting question so I

1966
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:10,760
leave it to you later makiko to explain

1967
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:13,920
to Derek uh where you are hiding in

1968
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:17,560
Rome okay

1969
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,560
um I see

1970
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:26,719
that okay uh Alejandro JZ the problem of

1971
01:30:23,239 --> 01:30:29,080
Dryland is is that they are dry climate

1972
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:32,600
change will intensify this condition

1973
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:35,760
particularly in hot countries can you

1974
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:37,719
expand uh fo suggested strategy to

1975
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:41,520
overcome this huge challenge for

1976
01:30:37,719 --> 01:30:44,280
instance in Middle East or meso America

1977
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:46,880
uh some comments on water energy Nexus

1978
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:49,400
in rural zones I think this is not only

1979
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:54,960
for FAO I think is also open to all

1980
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:59,119
panelists right so perhaps uh I use my

1981
01:30:54,960 --> 01:31:02,960
power to perhap ask Jackie uh what is

1982
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:05,639
your perspective on this Jackie um how

1983
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:08,000
to you know to overcome this huge

1984
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:10,790
Challenge and especially taking into

1985
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,719
account water energy Nexus in the rural

1986
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:16,320
[Music]

1987
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:21,119
Zone thank you I was just thinking about

1988
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:24,679
water dry lands because there is

1989
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:29,480
water there is you can condense water in

1990
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:32,159
the desert in the mornings you can find

1991
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:34,119
groundw but what's happening is that

1992
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:37,199
when you get sudden rains like we're

1993
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:39,320
getting with climate change it runs off

1994
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:43,159
and we're not it's not going into the

1995
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:47,080
water table and so yes technically

1996
01:31:43,159 --> 01:31:51,040
you're losing it and I think

1997
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:54,960
that again this is a huge Regional

1998
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:58,159
approach because you can't

1999
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,880
fix the dry lands by fixing one corner

2000
01:31:58,159 --> 01:32:02,440
of

2001
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:05,400
it um Greening across the

2002
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:08,000
SEL with trees and other vegetation

2003
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:11,400
that's a good start because if we can

2004
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:16,080
get it green it will retain water so

2005
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:18,280
decent crops that are not wasting water

2006
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:20,840
are not a bad way to start as

2007
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:24,239
well can I pass it to someone else now

2008
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:26,159
Yodi yeah thank you jaie that is helpful

2009
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:28,920
um any other panel members want to

2010
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:28,920
contribute to

2011
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:37,639
that if not then uh I have a question

2012
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:40,840
also digital Agriculture and new

2013
01:32:37,639 --> 01:32:44,400
business models have a lot of potential

2014
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:48,119
to promote more resilient Dryland

2015
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:51,080
systems um what are key bottlenecks to

2016
01:32:48,119 --> 01:32:55,320
developing and scaling up successful

2017
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:58,159
model perhaps I I would like to ask tamy

2018
01:32:55,320 --> 01:33:00,320
or tomoko to respond to that maybe start

2019
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:00,320
with

2020
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:08,760
tamy no thanks thanks very much Yodi I I

2021
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:13,639
would say maybe two things um the the

2022
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:15,880
first um bottleneck uh would be uh that

2023
01:33:13,639 --> 01:33:17,960
you know many many of those business

2024
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:20,719
models are implemented by small and

2025
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:22,760
medium scale businesses um on the

2026
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:26,080
continent many of those businesses

2027
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:28,400
struggle a lot uh struggle for to access

2028
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:30,199
information struggle to you know

2029
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:32,119
understand the political Dynamics and

2030
01:33:30,199 --> 01:33:35,000
how it affect the businesses you know

2031
01:33:32,119 --> 01:33:37,560
struggle to access the right resources

2032
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:42,440
right so I I I think one of the things

2033
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:44,760
we need to do is to uh encourage um you

2034
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:46,719
know the the creation of you know

2035
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:48,520
communities that encourage these

2036
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:51,000
businesses to be able to come together

2037
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:53,360
work together and really support each

2038
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,320
other learn from each other and maybe

2039
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:58,560
that's just what they need to to be able

2040
01:33:55,320 --> 01:34:01,000
to scale their you know um unique

2041
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:03,400
innovative business models and and I've

2042
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,560
seen that in practice with the work uh

2043
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,639
we're doing I'm also the executive chair

2044
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:12,800
at African food Change makers which is

2045
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:14,520
uh a you know uh a hub a community of

2046
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,800
entrepreneurs across the continent and

2047
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:19,520
I'm beginning to

2048
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:22,679
see um a lot of uh impacts on businesses

2049
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:24,480
that are within the Hub uh currently uh

2050
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:27,040
Hub house members are across more than

2051
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:28,880
43 countries in Africa and you know it

2052
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:30,520
keeps growing every day and it shows

2053
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:33,600
that it's just one of those critical

2054
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:38,360
things that that is needed the other

2055
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:41,440
second uh point would be um every

2056
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:45,560
innovative business model no matter how

2057
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:48,040
Innovative it is also require Innovative

2058
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:50,199
financing and I think and I think we

2059
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:52,880
need to rethink you know the concept of

2060
01:34:50,199 --> 01:34:54,960
financing for you know uh agricultural

2061
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:57,000
Innovations of business Innovations in

2062
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:58,880
Africa and ensure that uh those

2063
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,080
businesses have access to the right you

2064
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:03,560
know financing that is not expensive and

2065
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:07,840
that is you know

2066
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:11,119
competitive thank you tamy uh tomoko any

2067
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:13,239
addition from you briefly maybe just

2068
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:16,960
quickly kind of adding to Timmy's last

2069
01:35:13,239 --> 01:35:18,880
point about financing model I think um

2070
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,800
one thing you know that that's difficult

2071
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:24,199
is you know when you're building a

2072
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:26,480
service for like a small scale p OT you

2073
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:29,000
know time bound pilot the things that

2074
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:31,840
you need to figure out to be successful

2075
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,800
there may not be the same as things

2076
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:36,119
questions that you need to figure out to

2077
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:38,080
create a you know long-term sustainable

2078
01:35:36,119 --> 01:35:40,199
model at scale you know it's about

2079
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:42,280
technology needs the data security

2080
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:45,000
Quality Maintenance and of course

2081
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:47,040
importantly resourcing as well um so I

2082
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,400
think I think there a kind of bringing

2083
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:51,520
in how you know the vision of how the

2084
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:54,760
the service would really look like and

2085
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:56,400
what you need to figure out um from the

2086
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:58,560
beginning I think is something really

2087
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:00,520
important but but challenging because of

2088
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:03,639
the way lot of the funding is

2089
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:05,719
structured yeah thank you very much now

2090
01:36:03,639 --> 01:36:07,719
uh last question and I hope the answer

2091
01:36:05,719 --> 01:36:10,080
will be brief I would like to direct it

2092
01:36:07,719 --> 01:36:14,280
to shami and

2093
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:16,400
Marcela uh for you to you know to answer

2094
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:19,360
what are some of the key Technologies

2095
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:22,119
and Innovation that you think have

2096
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:24,760
potential to truly impact Dryland

2097
01:36:22,119 --> 01:36:27,800
ecosystems and Market systems in the

2098
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:30,560
coming years uh Marcela you may want to

2099
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:33,239
reflect you know from your you know GCF

2100
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,600
experience and and shami from your own

2101
01:36:33,239 --> 01:36:36,800
experience in Africa maybe shami you can

2102
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:40,560
start

2103
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:42,239
first yes thank you very much um yeah I

2104
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,960
just want to speak from the context of

2105
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:46,199
addressing the key pertinent challenges

2106
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:49,639
from a technological perspective uh

2107
01:36:46,199 --> 01:36:51,920
water carbon and nutrients and we need

2108
01:36:49,639 --> 01:36:54,719
Integrated Solutions that help to

2109
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:56,920
conserve water and then ensure that we

2110
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:59,320
are adding sufficient and balanced

2111
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:01,800
nutrients and then as well as carbon so

2112
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:03,600
there's a whole uh range of technologies

2113
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:06,400
that need to be fit into specific

2114
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:09,159
context and um conservation agriculture

2115
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:11,360
is one technology that um has great

2116
01:37:09,159 --> 01:37:13,920
potential because it addresses all the

2117
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:16,000
three um you know essential components

2118
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:19,040
but we have to pay more attention to

2119
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,920
water harvesting water conservation and

2120
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:24,719
then combine that with um nutrient

2121
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:27,159
inputs from uh organic resources and

2122
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:32,119
mineral fertilizers but more importantly

2123
01:37:27,159 --> 01:37:35,440
also invest in the right um crops and uh

2124
01:37:32,119 --> 01:37:37,719
plant species that are adapted to the

2125
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:39,920
poor swells and low rentfor situations

2126
01:37:37,719 --> 01:37:42,040
as well and I want to highlight the role

2127
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,840
of legumes in the systems where they can

2128
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:46,639
add high quality biomass for improving

2129
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:49,239
nitrogen Supply that can actually add

2130
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:51,960
more nutrients through more sustainable

2131
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:55,199
processes thank you very much thank you

2132
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:58,400
shami Marcel

2133
01:37:55,199 --> 01:38:02,960
yes I think that um it is very important

2134
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:05,960
to have technology in order to provide

2135
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:10,119
uh what for forecast for

2136
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:12,000
farmers in terms of uh decision making

2137
01:38:10,119 --> 01:38:14,360
in know Salvador for example the big

2138
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:18,480
question every year is when should I

2139
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:21,760
plant yes but still we also need for

2140
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:24,000
example um technical recommendations

2141
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:28,000
about how to prepare

2142
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,960
during the dry season just to face any

2143
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,719
event that can come within the rainy

2144
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:34,920
season and sometimes farmer just and

2145
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:37,400
they harvest their crops and they forget

2146
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:41,000
about the plot H but in the meantime

2147
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:44,520
they can still H Implement a sustainable

2148
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:46,199
practices just to minimize the impacts

2149
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:49,199
and so I think that that's very

2150
01:38:46,199 --> 01:38:52,400
important that's why I really ER was

2151
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:54,639
interested in in what tomoko share about

2152
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:56,440
the app they the already have we are

2153
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:59,639
still working on how to provide this

2154
01:38:56,440 --> 01:39:02,480
information to FAS thank you thank you

2155
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:04,280
very much Marcela very useful um

2156
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:06,520
colleagues I know that there are many

2157
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:09,840
questions you know because drylands are

2158
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:12,000
so huge problems are so big

2159
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:15,400
opportunities are so big you know

2160
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,599
potential uh you know immens uh I don't

2161
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:20,719
think we can solve all the question at

2162
01:39:17,599 --> 01:39:23,400
this webinar certainly from FAO part

2163
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:26,560
what I can say is that we will continue

2164
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:28,920
you know to use this platform uh you

2165
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:31,679
know to advance the

2166
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:34,320
discussion uh but because of time you

2167
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:37,199
know I really would like uh to end the

2168
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:41,320

ladies and gentlemen distinguished

2184
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:27,800
guests uh as we come to the close of

2185
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:30,800
this uh enlightening seminar on

2186
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:33,560
resilient dry lands innovating for

2187
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:36,159
sustainable agriculture Landscapes and

2188
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:38,960
livelihoods I would like to express my

2189
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:42,920
deepest thanks gratitude to all our

2190
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:45,840
speakers for sharing their expertise and

2191
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:48,000
all to all participants for your active

2192
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:50,320
engagement throughout the day I think

2193
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,719
this is a very important subject and and

2194
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:54,760
I'm really grateful for everybody I

2195
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:56,520
represent the near East and North Africa

2196
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:58,840
region which is one of the driest region

2197
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:01,080
we'll hear more about it it has been a

2198
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:03,880
privilege to learn about the Innovative

2199
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:07,480
approaches that are being implemented in

2200
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:10,840
Dryland regions uh across the globe from

2201
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:13,360
Africa uh to Central America to

2202
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:16,599
everywhere else in the world each

2203
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:19,639
contributing to the creation of more

2204
01:41:16,599 --> 01:41:22,800
resilient agriculture Landscapes and

2205
01:41:19,639 --> 01:41:24,119
livelihoods indeed dry land does not

2206
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:28,760
mean

2207
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:33,320
westand does not mean Wasteland so the

2208
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:38,040
the urgency for ecosystem restoration is

2209
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:40,960
very evident with uh nearly three

2210
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:45,400
quarters of the regions

2211
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:49,080
rainfed cropland degraded and water

2212
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:51,400
scarcity projected to cause substantial

2213
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:54,440
uh economic loss by

2214
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:57,440
2050 in the near e North Africa region

2215
01:41:54,440 --> 01:42:01,119
alone one of the driest regions in the

2216
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:04,480
world we Face similar challenges

2217
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:08,360
including water scarcity drought

2218
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:12,560
desertification land use rather land

2219
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:15,320
misuse land use changes and degradation

2220
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:18,040
all of which are exagerated by the

2221
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:20,760
impact of climate change leading to

2222
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:25,280
significant economic losses amounting to

2223
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:28,560
about 9 billion dollar a year uh or up

2224
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:31,880
to about 7% of the national gdps of Our

2225
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:34,239
member countries these issues have

2226
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:37,400
serious ramifications on the food

2227
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:39,880
security livelihoods and overall

2228
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:43,239
well-being of the populations mainly

2229
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:46,280
living in dry lands yet these challenges

2230
01:42:43,239 --> 01:42:49,360
are not

2231
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:52,080
insurable um the the inspiring solutions

2232
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:54,480
that we've discussed and heard today

2233
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:57,599
ranging from integrating traditional

2234
01:42:54,480 --> 01:43:01,360
knowledge with Cutting Edge Technologies

2235
01:42:57,599 --> 01:43:02,920
to enhancing soil health and promoting

2236
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:05,719
Agri food

2237
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:07,800
entrepreneurship prove that there are

2238
01:43:05,719 --> 01:43:10,199
clear Pathways and hopes and

2239
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:14,000
opportunities to sustainable development

2240
01:43:10,199 --> 01:43:17,639
in Dryland areas one key

2241
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:21,280
takeaways from this webinar is that

2242
01:43:17,639 --> 01:43:24,239
resilience in dry lands must be

2243
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:27,199
multifaceted it cannot be

2244
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:31,080
single Direction it is not just about

2245
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:33,800
increasing productivity but also about

2246
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:37,360
preserving ecosystems fostering

2247
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:40,960
Innovation and building local capacities

2248
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:43,800
to adapt to shocks and stresses most

2249
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:47,320
importantly it is about empowering the

2250
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:50,199
farmers and communities who are at the

2251
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:53,199
heart of these very challenging

2252
01:43:50,199 --> 01:43:53,199
landscapes

2253
01:43:53,400 --> 01:44:01,000
sop pastoral strategies are particularly

2254
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:04,320
relevant to Dryland areas with forests

2255
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:08,199
woodlands and Mosaic of different land

2256
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:13,040
uses and tener ecosystems trees in

2257
01:44:08,199 --> 01:44:16,400
Dryland forests and wooded areas provide

2258
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:21,159
essential ecosystems services including

2259
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:25,080
animal feed Timber fruits shap and

2260
01:44:21,159 --> 01:44:28,599
regulation of soil and water cycles

2261
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:31,560
equally livestock production is

2262
01:44:28,599 --> 01:44:35,000
considered a key activity for food

2263
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:37,800
security local knowledge enhanced by

2264
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,880
research and Innovation can create

2265
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:42,639
nature-based

2266
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:46,320
solutions that improve food security

2267
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:49,239
support livelihoods and restore Dryland

2268
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:52,679
ecosystems all while safeguarding

2269
01:44:49,239 --> 01:44:55,480
ecosystem services and achieving land

2270
01:44:52,679 --> 01:44:58,880
deg ration neutrality I would like to

2271
01:44:55,480 --> 01:45:00,800
highlight here in particular the region

2272
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:03,440
from the near East the importance of the

2273
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:05,199
a Oasis regions most of the Oasis that

2274
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:07,679
we have are in the middle of the dry

2275
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:10,040
lands and the deserts and there are key

2276
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:12,679
initiatives of creating alliances on

2277
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:15,679
Oasis development that we'd like to

2278
01:45:12,679 --> 01:45:17,920
focus on as we go in the future as one

2279
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:21,639
of the most fragile communities within

2280
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:25,719
dry lands as we conclude the seminar I

2281
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:29,360
urge each of you to take decisive

2282
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:32,360
actions these are there are several key

2283
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:35,639
action areas that I wish to highlight as

2284
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:39,520
a result of today's discussion notably

2285
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:43,119
as a development Community we must one

2286
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:45,599
invest in research and Innovation let us

2287
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:48,840
intensify our efforts to develop and

2288
01:45:45,599 --> 01:45:52,239
scale up Technologies tailored to dry

2289
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:54,599
land conditions this includes not only

2290
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:57,480
agricultural Innovations but also

2291
01:45:54,599 --> 01:46:01,239
digital solutions that can Empower

2292
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:03,760
farmers and realtime information big

2294
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:11,400
access two promote policy integration I

2295
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:15,800
urge policy makers to ensure that

2296
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:18,639
Dryland agriculture is mainstreamed into

2297
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:21,880
NA national development strategies

2298
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:25,360
climate action plans and food security

2299
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:28,599
policies we need holistic approaches

2300
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:32,239
that recognize the interconnectedness of

2301
01:46:28,599 --> 01:46:34,360
land water and biodiversity management

development goals especially that we're

2365
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:39,280
approaching our Target for 2030 and we

2366
01:49:35,239 --> 01:49:40,400
know that we are 75% off track of all

2367
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:44,199
