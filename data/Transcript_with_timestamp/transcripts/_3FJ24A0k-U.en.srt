66
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,879
of our

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,959
speakers this morning

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,720
okay thanks

69
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,440
so i'm gonna kind of kick things off

70
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,519
here and um really before we get into

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,599
the the meats of the

72
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,959
chickpea flax i'm gonna go over a little

73
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,080
bit of uh

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,120
an overview uh just to of what we're

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,040
saying when we're talking about

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,720
intercropping and then just some of the

77
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,319
basic concepts

78
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,280
uh behind it

79
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,640
so

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,480
for instance here we're talking about

81
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,000
chickpea flax

82
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,519
this here's a picture i took right off

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,440
the combine

84
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,120
so you can see

85
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,120
i think this is a combination that

86
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,879
actually threshes out really well when

87
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
they're combined together

88
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,200
they've got a few

89
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,000
green foxtail in this particular sample

90
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,159
but overall other than that really nice

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,519
clean samples so what we're talking

92
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,000
about

93
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,680
uh when we say inner cropping meaning

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,040
we're gonna plants

95
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,040
and harvest

96
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,040
two crops or more

97
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,400
at the same time so

98
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,480
we're not talking about making extra

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,080
passes across the field during the

100
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,480
growing season

101
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,120
but we are usually talking about

102
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,120
separating the harvested grain out after

103
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,440
harvest in almost all cases okay

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,519
so one extra step usually after harvest

105
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,200
but hopefully no extra steps during the

106
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,200
growing season compared to growing a

107
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,120
single crop

108
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,879
right and so

109
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,280
uh this is generally something that can

110
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,440
be used um

111
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,120
to as a way to increase

112
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,319
space efficiency

113
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,640
uh so

114
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,879
um i think particularly if somebody has

115
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,120
a limited number of acres uh this might

116
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,400
be particularly appealing because you

117
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,920
can make better use of of each acre

118
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,920
and just a few things to note that

119
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,280
some a lot of times you might have a

120
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,280
lower cost of production

121
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,440
simply because there aren't as many

122
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,040
options as you have with one prop

123
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,479
uh because when you start talking about

124
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,720
pest management programs uh oftentimes

125
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,320
you don't have that many options and so

126
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,440
on a necessity

127
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,680
even

128
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,240
even if you plan on doing things

129
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,080
uh cheaper because of some synergies you

130
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,440
might see you might actually be forced

131
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,720
into lower cost of production as well

132
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,080
and then

133
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,720
when we're doing this we do really need

134
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,160
to also try to pair our maturities of

135
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,160
our crops

136
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,400
to make the best use of the

137
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,000
reducing number of operations in the

138
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,040
field

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,520
okay

140
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,000
so here's a few pictures

141
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,080
from the carrington research center of

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,919
this particular combination of the

143
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,680
chickpea flax we don't have the ability

144
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,680
to alternate rows

145
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,039
on the equipment we have

146
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,800
so there's a lot of debates right off

147
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,000
the bat on whether it's best to

148
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,560
alternate rows or go same rural on

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,639
everything right and i think there's

150
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,479
some advantages disadvantages

151
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,800
to either but

152
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,560
uh first and foremost

153
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,280
uh what we need to determine is what our

154
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,720
equipment capabilities are right and so

155
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,560
our equipment is not capable of

156
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,080
alternating rows so we put everything in

157
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,400
the same pearl

158
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,039
uh and it's worked pretty well for us

159
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,759
uh we have our uh

160
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,240
black salon our chickpeas alone

161
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,000
and then here you can see we have a

162
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,360
pretty nice flat stand and if you look

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,440
down the rows you'll be able to see all

164
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,199
these little chickpea plants growing

165
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,000
underneath

166
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,000
very healthily

167
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,840
the one thing

168
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,280
that um

169
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,960
i i really noticed in particular in 2020

170
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,960
when we were doing this trial

171
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,319
so if you look down the rows looking at

172
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,759
trying to find all the chickpeas down

173
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,919
here in the plaques

174
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,400
uh we also saw

175
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,240
all right what's the one big weakness on

176
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,520
on flax weed management or at least for

177
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,039
us

178
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,919
uh

179
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,319
so you can use sulfentrazone ahead of

180
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,520
plaques which is excellent

181
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,240
but the one big weakness of

182
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,080
sulfentrazone is pigweeds right and so

183
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
we almost always have pigweeds in our

184
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,199
flax crop

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,680
all right that's not too bad right here

186
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,479
we use sulfentrazone in this combination

187
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,240
uh you can see a few uh pigweeds popping

188
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,759
up here of where the chickpeas are okay

189
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,440
but the thing i really noticed is when

190
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,800
we had the chickpeas and the flax

191
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,240
growing together

192
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,400
we actually saw

193
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,199
a very noticeable

194
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,960
reduction in the in the

195
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,199
size and stature of the pigweeds that

196
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,319
we're growing in here as well so

197
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
uh

198
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,120
definitely wanted to point that out as

199
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,840
even though we do have maybe

200
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,240
reduced options for herbicides

201
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,759
when we're doing mixed combinations we

202
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,599
actually can see

203
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,599
an added benefit of biological weed

204
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,280
suppression right

205
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,400
all right so

206
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,360
a few other notes here

207
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,960
so

208
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,199
i just want to point out that normally i

209
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,720
do these presentations in a standard

210
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,400
agronomy meeting

211
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,160
people aren't really

212
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,400
necessarily looking to do something new

213
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,680
and so i really try to pair people's

214
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,280
expectations down because i think

215
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,280
there's a lot of potential

216
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,479
but with inner cropping but

217
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,319
there are definitely some things we need

218
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,919
to think about before i really encourage

219
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,919
people to go down this route so

220
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,599
number one this trade-off here

221
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,759
i

222
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,319
can over-yielding

223
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,840
by having two crops growing together

224
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,479
uh make up for the cost of separating

225
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,400
grain and the cost of potentially two

226
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,919
different seed lots okay

227
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,479
so that's one of the first things we

228
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:02,800
need to consider

229
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,440
very likely we will be needing to

230
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,560
desiccate more so than if we had each

231
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,759
crop alone that's not always the case

232
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,960
but i would say there's an increased

233
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,120
chance that we're going to have to

234
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,800
either desiccate or swap

235
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,199
okay we have

236
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,639
less pest management options

237
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,400
okay and then some of the ones that are

238
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,080
labeled for multiple crops in our

239
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,120
systems are usually not quite as

240
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,720
effective

241
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,520
as the best ones you can use for either

242
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,599
crop alone but as i mentioned

243
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,479
sometimes the as long as you can keep it

244
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,919
clean

245
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,000
in the beginning

246
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,839
uh usually the late season weed control

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,839
is better

248
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,320
by by the biological weed suppression

249
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,240
right uh and then it also takes time

250
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,040
to perfect a new system

251
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,560
i definitely do not tell people to go in

252
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,600
and plant a hundred acres your first

253
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,320
year uh this is something where we'd say

254
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,360
uh maybe try five or ten acres see what

255
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,519
you think

256
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,440
see how it works for you

257
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,920
right because this is not

258
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
simplifying anything right by doing this

259
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,600
we're trying to get more production but

260
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,440
we're making it more complicated and we

261
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,200
need to figure some things out it's

262
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,399
going to look different from farm to

263
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,279
farm

264
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,800
right

265
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,160
and then also there's other basic

266
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,519
management things we need to figure out

267
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,000
too such as

268
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,720
uh you know do we have to add fertilizer

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,959
if we have a legume partner in our mix

270
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,120
all right so uh there's a lot of things

271
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,120
that we're still trying to figure out

272
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,560
uh and a lot of things that

273
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,760
you need to figure out doing this on a

274
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,279
farm as well

275
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
okay

276
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,480
um

277
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,120
i think this one

278
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,360
might have been outdoors but okay

279
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
so

280
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,519
just to give you an example uh one of

281
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,760
the basic concepts

282
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,839
i think in in intercropping it's not the

283
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,120
only thing right but one of the major

284
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,640
things that we

285
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,399
probably will all talk about at some

286
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,080
point today is this concept of over

287
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,120
yielding all right

288
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,519
and

289
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,640
for those that need to calculate this on

290
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,040
the farm

291
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,519
this is the basic concept

292
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,120
so let's say on a normal year you grow a

293
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,360
pop crop

294
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,279
and your your yield is 50 bushels an

295
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,120
acre all right

296
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,560
you have a canola crop and your yield is

297
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,560
2 000 pounds an acre

298
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,200
okay now you do an inner crop and just

299
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,160
in this example here

300
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,040
let's say you plant

301
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,959
two thirds of your normal field piece

302
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,480
eating rate two-thirds of your normal

303
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,320
canola rates

304
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,959
and you might get

305
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,320
38 bushels instead of 50

306
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,360
and 1400 pounds instead of 2 000 okay

307
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,040
so in this example

308
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,519
this is 100 of a normal pea crop 100 of

309
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,079
a normal canola crop

310
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,440
and down here we've got

311
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,399
76

312
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,680
of a normal pea crop and 70 of a normal

313
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,519
canola crop

314
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,240
so you add those together

315
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,519
and in this example you would have

316
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,120
a 46

317
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,360
increase in yield

318
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,200
um over either crop alone now that's

319
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,640
pretty hot this is i'm just trying to

320
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,440
use some easier numbers to work with

321
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,680
here

322
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,079
we don't normally see

323
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,680
almost a 50 percent yield increase but

324
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,800
30

325
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,959
is

326
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,079
uh what i would consider an achievable

327
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,760
target

328
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,040
all right and you don't always get there

329
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,279
either but i think that's something to

330
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,240
shoot for

331
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,560
okay and another way to say this is uh

332
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,720
this is what we would call our ler or

333
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,000
land equivalency ratio

334
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,920
and this example this 50 increase uh we

335
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,720
would write that out as like a 1.46 46

336
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,720
more yield than either crop on its own

337
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,720
okay

338
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,120
all right so uh i just wanted to bring

339
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,959
an example of this here as we go so

340
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,279
what does this mean

341
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,320
so this this is an actual data set that

342
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,120
we had

343
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,120
so we have um this listed as our canola

344
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,000
seeding rate first and then our field

345
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,160
piece seating rate second

346
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
so

347
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,440
i didn't list the yields here quite yet

348
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,360
but so we have 100 field pea yield 100

349
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,040
canola yield and this is what it looked

350
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,959
like when we combined them

351
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,000
so when we added canola

352
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,600
we got

353
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,279
a pretty big reduction in our field pea

354
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,040
production okay

355
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,399
but the field peas did not affect our

356
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,600
canola

357
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,480
we saw a maximum of around 25 percent

358
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,800
reduction in our canola yields okay so

359
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,279
you add those two together and we saw

360
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,680
anywhere from a 10 to 23

361
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,120
increase in total yield

362
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,360
now

363
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,760
now for the downfall of the ler it is

364
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,800
not everything right

365
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,240
profits

366
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,040
is what's going to be the most

367
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,480
attractive thing in the system right

368
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,839
so what happens when we actually plug in

369
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,160
the yield

370
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,399
so

371
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,399
uh

372
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,720
the average canola yield this year

373
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,320
was actually

374
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,880
3 400 pounds fantastic canola

375
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,120
our field peas we're only like 35

376
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,040
bushels a maker all right so

377
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,720
we have our ler combined values here

378
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,560
17 16 23 over yielding you say well

379
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,079
those look pretty close

380
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,240
but when you actually puts

381
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:26,399
the the gross return on not net return

382
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,519
yet when you compute your gross return

383
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,880
we actually see a very big discrepancy

384
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,440
so um up here on the on the upper right

385
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,920
this uh column labeled field p

386
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,399
this would be like if you were growing a

387
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,480
field pea crop

388
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,680
what would happen when you add canola to

389
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,839
it all right

390
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,040
and so because the canola yield was

391
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,720
really good

392
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
if we are a field pea grower adding

393
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,760
canola

394
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,760
we're almost always coming out

395
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,519
substantially ahead

396
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,480
because our field pea was only okay and

397
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,639
our canola was fantastic that all right

398
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,720
this column will be if you're a canola

399
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,279
grower and you wanted to add field pizza

400
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,959
that mixture right from that perspective

401
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,519
in this case

402
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,480
uh you're sometimes better off growing

403
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,720
just canola economically all right there

404
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,760
are a few times here this particular

405
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,000
mixture we came out 100 ahead by adding

406
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,800
field piece to our canola because our

407
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,920
canola yield was almost identical

408
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,839
uh to what our monocrop canola yield was

409
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:33,839
but here this 20 reduction in canola

410
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,839
yield resulted in a big swing

411
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,959
economically here because the field peas

412
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,079
did not make up that difference

413
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,480
based on the price of each crop okay so

414
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,720
ler is interesting it gives us a good

415
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,560
indicator what our system is doing but

416
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,320
economically it might tell a little bit

417
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,000
different story so i just wanted to

418
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,800
bring that up

419
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,600
okay

420
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,639
so

421
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,120
back to chickpea flax

422
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,000
uh why why are we considering chickpea

423
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,000
flex and um you know you notice the

424
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,760
program uh we really have two things

425
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,639
we're talking about field peak canola

426
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,880
chickpea flax right so why

427
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,040
all right for chickpea flax

428
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,360
how we have two very different plant

429
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,600
types right we have chickpeas and flex

430
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,839
and completely different plant families

431
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,760
uh so very different architectures

432
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,240
very different ways they use

433
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,920
nutrients water

434
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,440
different ways that they grow different

435
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,720
architectures they're using sunlight

436
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,839
differently

437
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,880
and when you start talking about

438
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,120
system efficiencies your cropping system

439
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,399
that's a very very big plus in the way

440
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,399
that it's going to be able to utilize

441
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,600
resources okay

442
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,959
doesn't always mean it's going to turn

443
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,800
out in your favor

444
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,000
just at least theoretically this is a

445
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,000
really good thing all right

446
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,160
we've seen some increases in weed

447
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,680
control

448
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,079
i think in some cases we're getting more

449
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,240
yield per acre and um we're going to

450
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,839
talk quite a little bit about um ask a

451
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,920
kite of light coming up because we've

452
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,759
seen some uh really nice things from

453
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,920
that perspective so

454
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,839
we're just kind of pausing mid talk to

455
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,519
briefly give an introduction to ask okay

456
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,120
to play if you're not you're a chickpea

457
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,720
producer you're familiar with it but if

458
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,639
chickpea is new to you you're not so we

459
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,240
just wanted to make sure everyone

460
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,759
was on the same page regarding this

461
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,120
pathogen if you're if you've not grown

462
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,759
chickpea i think it can be a little bit

463
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,079
of a boogeyman you've heard about it it

464
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,600
know it's aggressive it's kind of scary

465
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,360
um but

466
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,800
hopefully by the end of my slides you'll

467
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,560
kind of have an idea if you have an

468
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,240
integrated disease management plan it's

469
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,079
not so bad

470
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,759
well it's bad but you need to you can

471
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,680
manage it all right so it's a fungal

472
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,360
pathogen um you're probably familiar

473
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,440
with ascochyte of light on lentils or

474
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
acidopyths

475
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,880
just know that this is a different

476
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,959
pathogen it's specific to chickpea so if

477
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,519
you're adding chickpea into a pea lentil

478
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,600
rotation it's not going to increase your

479
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,680
foliar ascochyta problems and lethal

480
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,279
repeat

481
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,079
it does affect all plant parts so you

482
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,040
can see lesions here on the pods the

483
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,199
stem

484
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,400
and the leaf it forms these kind of

485
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,760
really diagnostic bullseye pattern on

486
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,520
the on the plant and that bullseye those

487
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,079
are little fungal structures and i'll

488
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,319
talk a little bit about that later

489
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,120
it can develop really quickly but you

490
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,120
need kind of wet cool conditions a year

491
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,079
like this year where it was really hot

492
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,559
and really dry does really reduce the

493
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,880
amount of disease that you get

494
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,720
um this is an example this is a

495
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,919
fungicide trial that i had under

496
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,280
irrigation

497
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,120
without this is

498
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,440
no no fungicides um and i'm inoculating

499
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,120
it with chickpea residue that has been

500
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,960
overwintered somewhere so i'm doing

501
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,320
everything i can to get a lot of disease

502
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,480
because that's my job

503
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,640
um and and so if you're not controlling

504
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,840
it it can be quite quite aggressive and

505
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,240
you can end up with complete yield loss

506
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,840
but with this pathogen you know enter we

507
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
want to talk about using inner cropping

508
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,200
and just know that's going to be one

509
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,679
part of your management strategy

510
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,799
if if that's what you want to do

511
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,960
so

512
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,440
let's talk about where this pathogen

513
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,280
comes from how it overwinters and how it

514
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,880
spreads within the crop because that's

515
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,559
where the concept of intercropping is

516
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,320
going to come in

517
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,640
so the red circle here that's what's

518
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,320
happening in season

519
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,679
you've got these lesions on your leaf

520
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,720
and we'll talk about how they got there

521
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,240
to begin with but all these little dots

522
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,039
within that lesion these are called

523
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,039
magnetium and they're full of spores

524
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,480
called canadian

525
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,160
and

526
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,919
what's important here is that this is

527
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,480
this is a cycle so these these are going

528
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,919
to germinate and release spores under

529
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,480
wet humid conditions and then rain

530
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,480
and wind are going to spread them around

531
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,080
so the more rain you have the more

532
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,559
spread you get

533
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,640
and this can happen over and over and

534
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,200
over and over again within the growing

535
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,559
season so the more lesions you have the

536
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,000
more canadian you have and the more

537
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,799
spread you have so it's just important

538
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,630
to keep that initial number of lesions

539
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,720
low and get ahead of it

540
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,440
[Music]

541
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,440
all right so

542
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,640
so this is what it's going to be doing

543
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,200
in season

544
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,200
across seasons so you end up with these

545
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,600
stem lesions right you're cutting it

546
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,360
pretty low um so you're going to be

547
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,840
removing some of the pathogen but it's

548
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,160
going out the back of the combine too so

549
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,960
that's going to be your inoculum source

550
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,440
along with the pathogen born on the seed

551
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,919
so if you have contaminated seed

552
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,919
as that seed germinates it can affect

553
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,760
seed germination you're going to end up

554
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,080
with some lesions probably earlier in

555
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,840
the season than you would have otherwise

556
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,400
and again then you start your cycles

557
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,400
earlier which you don't want and then if

558
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,919
that residue is there

559
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,679
that's going to be really the main

560
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,840
provider of inoculum

561
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,440
so all of our management strategies

562
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,520
always have to do with the pathogen

563
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,600
biology and that's why i want you to

564
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,919
understand how this pathogen works

565
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,640
within and across seasons

566
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,559
so our management strategies uh

567
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,240
i talk about ipm a lot just know that's

568
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,600
integrated pest management it just means

569
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,120
throwing everything you can at the

570
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,360
pathogen so we'll start with our

571
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,520
prevention right seed testing seed

572
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,120
treatment and crop rotation and then

573
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,200
spacing out where you're planting your

574
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,280
chickpea fields right if your neighbor

575
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,200
had chickpea last year don't plant

576
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,520
chickpea right next to your neighbor's

577
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,640
chicken that will provide an inoculum

578
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,440
source

579
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,280
and same thing within your own land

580
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,600
uh there is there's documented

581
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,440
literature that increased row spacing

582
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,360
will prevent the spread of that pathogen

583
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,039
in your crop so potentially that's where

584
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,720
the inner cropping comes in you're

585
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,000
increasing your plant spacing but then

586
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,720
you don't have a bunch of bare dirt

587
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,320
where you're not getting any yield

588
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,520
variety selection i'll talk a little bit

589
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,440
about that

590
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,200
you need to be on top of the pathogen

591
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,440
out there scouting for it this is not

592
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,200
like peas or lentils right the

593
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,520
fungicides are going to start when you

594
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,200
see the pathogen right away

595
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,720
you really do have to get ahead of it

596
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,280
and we'll talk about the final sites as

597
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,960
well so this is a stacked approach and

598
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,120
intercropping can definitely be a part

599
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,440
of your approach

600
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,120
all right so if you're new to chickpea

601
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,960
just know that you can get your seed

602
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,559
tested if you're running bin run seed

603
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,159
please test your seed

604
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,760
um 0.3

605
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,360
is your threshold of whether you want to

606
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,679
plant that or not

607
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,280
so don't don't plan chickpea without

608
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,520
testing your seed if you're buying

609
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,760
chickpea seed you should know what your

610
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,520
ascochyta bite levels are

611
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,159
you can send it to the state seed lab in

612
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,159
north dakota or you can send it to the

613
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,400
regional pulse crops diagnostic lab at

614
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,520
montana state um just know it's got

615
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,200
there's going to be a little bit of time

616
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,640
to turn around seven to ten days and no

617
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,159
we can't shorten that because that's how

618
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,159
long it takes for the pathogen to grow

619
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,799
and then um in terms of seed treatment

620
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,480
just make sure you're checking the label

621
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,080
or checking our

622
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,080
uh field

623
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,400
field disease management guide and

624
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,760
making sure it says ascochyto blight and

625
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,600
also pithium pythium is also an

626
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,120
important packaging so just make sure

627
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,559
when you're getting your fungicides you

628
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,880
know those actives

629
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,840
include control of these two pathogens

630
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,840
and it should say

631
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,000
all right so let's talk about variety of

632
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,760
resistance i've color coded these these

633
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,440
are two variety trials i've done over

634
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,600
the past two years

635
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,360
obviously yield has not been optimal in

636
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,600
either of those years and this year

637
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,000
disease levels were really low but even

638
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,400
so we're able to distinguish the very

639
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
susceptible chickpea varieties from the

640
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,919
moderately susceptible chickpea

641
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,840
varieties and you definitely want to go

642
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,440
with the latter so here we have we're

643
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,720
comparing cdc

644
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,000
cedar city leader cdc orion sawyer royal

645
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,760
and sierra

646
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,600
there are some different seed sizes in

647
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,919
there so make sure you know what seed

648
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,280
seed side class you're in

649
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,360
andy crown

650
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,120
i don't have on this slide

651
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,400
it is in our

652
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,039
annual report this year for the

653
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,200
williston rec but it kind of fell in

654
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,520
with the leaders in the frontiers so

655
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,880
this is percent severity of ascochyta

656
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,720
blight

657
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,880
the lines in blue kind of cluster

658
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,000
together and the lines in red cluster

659
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,760
together that's just based on

660
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,159
statistical analysis you see disease

661
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,720
severity is higher in the royal and the

662
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,159
sierra and that results in a significant

663
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,120
yield loss

664
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,840
even in a in a year where we have less

665
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,280
disease so making sure you're not

666
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,840
growing a variety that is highly

667
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,840
susceptible

668
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,559
but know that you know in the case of

669
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,559
chickpea production in australia they

670
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,120
did have their disease resistance which

671
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,280
was quite strong in their their chickpea

672
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,200
varieties there overcome

673
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,440
it took about 10 years but their variety

674
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,120
resistance was overcome and that's just

675
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,039
because the pathogen wasn't being

676
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,960
controlled in other ways as well so

677
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,960
that's why i keep harping on stacking

678
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,200
your disease management approach because

679
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,720
there's cases where we don't have that

680
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,080
approach anymore in other countries and

681
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,840
i don't want that to be where we end up

682
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,520
all right so fungicides

683
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,200
there's a lot of old literature out

684
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,840
there that talks about using strabile

685
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,720
urines for the control of ascochyta

686
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,720
blight

687
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,559
resistance was detected kind of in the

688
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,320
mid

689
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,400
2008-2007

690
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,440
in canada it's been documented here in

691
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,279
north dakota so know that you cannot use

692
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,720
cervilians for control of ascopido

693
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,960
blight and shifty they are not effective

694
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,559
the pathogen is resistant

695
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,760
so products where you've got that in the

696
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,000
tank mixed to just know you're not

697
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,000
getting anything from that

698
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,080
um so we're using the factory and the

699
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,520
frac seven a lot of the products are

700
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,760
combo products where they have both of

701
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,440
those groups just if you're applying

702
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,919
more than one application in the season

703
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,960
make sure you're rotating those

704
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,640
and then

705
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,120
michael bunch and i have been working on

706
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,360
tank mixes with chlorothalonil

707
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,360
take maxine chlorothalin with proline

708
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,200
results in really really excellent

709
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,720
disease control right now and the bonus

710
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,640
of that chlorothalinoid is that it's a

711
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,720
multi-site mode of action

712
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,480
and we're helping again control the

713
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,159
pathogen overcoming these products so

714
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,000
that we can have them available to us

715
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,440
for a longer period of time you know so

716
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,640
far we don't have resistance to these

717
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,720
but it's really important that we take

718
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,760
care of these products we're rotating

719
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,000
and we're stacking these other

720
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,760
approaches like intercropping so we

721
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,600
don't get a highly aggressive pathogen

722
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,600
that we can't control

723
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,520
so first timing is going to vary based

724
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,880
on your growing season when do you see

725
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,880
that disease occur in the field just

726
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,400
keep an eye on it

727
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,919
you know if you don't see it up until

728
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,240
flowering your earliest application

729
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,159
could be at early flowering

730
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,080
and then the window is 10 to 14 days

731
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,240
usually in my research trials i'll do

732
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,159
the end of that window the 14 days and

733
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,120
we have a pretty short growing season

734
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,679
some years i've combined chickpeas

735
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,279
mid-august some years but october other

736
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,640
years so it can vary um but

737
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,559
you know if you're on a mid-august

738
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,799
harvest time frame you know you might

739
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:38,159
end up in a really bad year two to three

740
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:41,760
applications here in the williston area

741
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:44,240
but usually um i do around two on my

742
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,240
disease trials i've done up to four

743
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,840
but again that the number of

744
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,279
applications you're gonna make is

745
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,360
dependent on the level of disease in

746
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,320
your field what the weather looks like

747
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,919
you know if you've got a big

748
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,960
thunderstorm coming and you're at the

749
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,520
end of your 14 day window spray ahead of

750
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,640
it right but if weather's hot and dry

751
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,480
maybe you can stretch it out a little

752
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,159
bit just keep an eye on it so it's just

753
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,679
going to be really weather dependent and

754
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,039
again depending on the level of disease

755
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,720
in your field which you've hopefully

756
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,400
minimized through

757
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,559
checking your seed growing a resistant

758
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,960
variety good crop rotation and inner

759
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,960
cropping

760
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,600
all right so mike's going to start us

761
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,919
off with some of the data they've

762
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,360
collected on

763
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,559
the computer

764
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,080
yeah thanks

765
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,120
all right so

766
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,039
um here's some examples of um what we've

767
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,279
been able to

768
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,919
work with with um

769
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,080
that chickpea flax so carrington

770
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,440
just a preface it's not a chickpea

771
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,039
growing region

772
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,400
uh it's never something i would tell

773
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,240
somebody to go yeah you should be

774
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,240
growing chickpeas out here

775
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,440
we do not have an environment for that

776
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,600
we do have a chickpea variety trial but

777
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,520
sometimes i don't know of five fungicide

778
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,039
applications would be enough to

779
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,640
optimally manage

780
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,600
chickpea alone okay

781
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,840
so just throwing that out there

782
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,840
so we do test chickpeas but nobody

783
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:09,120
really grows them okay in our region

784
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,000
now here we did a trial um over a couple

785
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,559
years

786
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,080
um and williston did a similar one here

787
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,480
with justin jacobs

788
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,480
um we're looking at different chickpea

789
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,120
and flax seeding rates

790
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,200
uh and whether we applied fungicide or

791
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,320
no fungicide now when we applied

792
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,159
fungicide here uh we were this would be

793
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,520
um

794
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,679
two times so two fungicide applications

795
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,640
uh versus none at all

796
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,600
all right

797
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,840
so there's

798
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,440
some things here uh again different

799
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,919
seating rates

800
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,000
uh so

801
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,399
um

802
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,240
here we have the chickpea seating rate

803
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,039
on the left and then the flex seating

804
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,039
rate on the right

805
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,720
and

806
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,000
as we go across our

807
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,120
our table

808
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,640
maybe we'll just start with the

809
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,720
ascochyta information the second column

810
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,720
in the yellow here

811
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:09,600
so with no fungicide and chickpeas alone

812
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,039
uh we had around uh fifty percent

813
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,440
incidence

814
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,840
in um ascochyta this was measured mid

815
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,760
mid season

816
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,320
um uh

817
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,880
actually two columns so measure twice in

818
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,080
the middle of this season okay

819
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,279
why don't we go to the green one the

820
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,200
green one

821
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,520
i think is a little bit more interesting

822
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,520
yet so

823
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,960
in this case we had 60 incidents uh a

824
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,880
little bit later here in early august

825
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,200
okay

826
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,039
and so now our chickpea alone with two

827
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,520
fungicide applications

828
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,840
we're able to cut that ascochyta

829
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,240
incidence down by about half so about

830
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,960
half the amount of masculine

831
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,320
in our plots all right

832
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,279
now

833
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,080
no fungicide but with different rates of

834
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,000
plaques mixed in with our chickpeas

835
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,960
look at these different

836
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,960
incidences of ascochyta

837
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,200
and you look at those numbers

838
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,600
compared to

839
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,640
chickpea alone with fungicide

840
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,320
so chickpea flax no fungicide at the

841
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,399
bottom

842
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,320
chickpea alone at the top

843
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,480
with fungicide the numbers are very

844
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,320
comparable right

845
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,640
very comparable

846
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,720
all right now we look at the top

847
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,840
fungicide

848
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,200
with inner cropping so essentially

849
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,120
just what uh

850
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,360
audrey was talking about layering so we

851
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,480
have two mechanisms of aspect kind of

852
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,480
control

853
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,559
and we reduce our ascochyta

854
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,440
substantially more

855
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,120
all right

856
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,440
so

857
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,279
fungicide in this case fungicide and

858
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,520
intercropping provided similar amounts

859
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,679
of control you do both

860
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,039
we had an even further reduction than

861
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,240
either

862
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:01,120
than either control method alone so

863
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,960
uh very fantastic news there now

864
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,440
uh we haven't been able to replicate

865
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,039
quite that same level of efficiency

866
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,640
since then so this isn't something you

867
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,520
should count on

868
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,760
but it's something that may be possible

869
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,399
in some cases okay

870
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,520
so again uh just to throw those numbers

871
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,039
out here a little more simplified if you

872
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,120
uh take the

873
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,440
i have the yields next to it as well the

874
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,240
final yields in both years here so

875
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,080
this year we went from 60 down to

876
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,679
roughly 30

877
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,279
with these two control methods

878
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,279
intercropping and fungicide

879
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,640
and then we reduced it even further with

880
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,279
both now in 2020

881
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,679
uh we saw again um not quite as much as

882
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,960
kakaida with our chickpea alone with no

883
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,080
fungicide

884
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,480
all right

885
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,480
once again we saw a pretty similar

886
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,960
amount of uh reduction whether we were

887
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,399
intercropping or just using fungicides

888
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,559
in our chickpeas

889
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,799
okay but the difference is

890
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,679
uh when we did both fungicide and

891
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,440
intercropping we didn't see that further

892
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,600
step down we saw maybe a slight

893
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,200
reduction in ascochyta with both but it

894
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,519
wasn't nearly as

895
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,559
pronounced as the year before right

896
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,640
now again

897
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,799
um

898
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,960
the uh that's not the end of the story

899
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,919
here all right

900
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,399
this year our flax did really well our

901
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,720
chickpeas didn't do so well and so

902
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,080
with a very aggressive flax crop and

903
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,360
conditions only

904
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,880
you know not very

905
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,880
great for chickpeas

906
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,960
we had huge yield reductions here in our

907
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,919
chickpeas so even though we had these

908
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,679
amazing drop downs in ascochyta control

909
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,440
um this year this might have been

910
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,159
financially feasible but most of the

911
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,840
time flex prices are more normal this

912
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,519
would probably be a bad thing for your

913
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,320
system right

914
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,240
all right

915
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,519
uh 2020 uh we had a much better chickpea

916
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,440
yields

917
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:59,200
um and flax seals were quite a bit lower

918
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,300
so we still saw a fair amount of

919
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,080
reduction in our chickpea yield

920
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,679
[Music]

921
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,200
not quite as much

922
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,519
so

923
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,000
depending on the prices again

924
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,519
now the one thing we learned is that

925
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,519
when we were doing these trials we

926
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,919
didn't really didn't have low enough

927
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,279
flax rates uh most of the time the flax

928
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,519
was just too competitive with the

929
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,440
chickpeas and we saw

930
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,000
really well i consider a lot of times

931
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,120
unacceptable chickpea yield loss because

932
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,399
most of the time that's going to be the

933
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,080
economic driver right

934
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,320
all right here's a little bit more

935
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,240
balance here where both the chickpeas

936
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,279
did really well and the flax did

937
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,360
actually uh quite well as well so it

938
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,320
wasn't always one way or the other uh in

939
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,360
2018 we had a year where we had

940
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,880
um kind of vote but nonetheless uh

941
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,039
because the flex

942
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,200
we really weren't testing low enough

943
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,880
flax rates in this year either

944
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,440
um and we still

945
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,399
most likely unacceptable yield loss

946
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,039
because if you could market over three

947
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,880
three thousand pounds of chickpea when

948
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,080
you're going on its own

949
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,600
odds are you're gonna be pretty happy

950
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,840
with that so

951
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,480
uh once

952
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,039
again uh

953
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,640
very good for asking title blades um but

954
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,159
i think we need to be really careful at

955
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,159
least in carrington

956
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,919
area with the rate of flex that we're

957
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,799
using

958
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,240
so

959
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,720
to summarize what we've been going

960
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,720
through here

961
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,480
so

962
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,600
in carrington without any control

963
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,760
measures

964
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,320
we might we've been expecting 50 to 60

965
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,320
percent incidence of that circada uh

966
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,399
some years is higher than that this is

967
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,519
what the medium resistor the

968
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,320
one of the

969
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,399
less

970
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,919
susceptible varieties so we have a

971
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,559
little bit of genetic resistance built

972
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,720
in there already too so 50 to 60

973
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,480
incidence of infection

974
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,640
uh we were able to cut that down by

975
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,200
about half to either of these practices

976
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,760
or down to about 75 percent reduction by

977
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,760
stacking and best case scenario okay

978
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,080
all right um

979
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,039
and

980
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,919
i think this was specific to the 2019.

981
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,320
uh our monocrop chickpea

982
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,159
had an 80 reduction in yield without our

983
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,520
fungicide

984
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,480
when we were intercropping our chickpea

985
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,159
we were able to gain thirty percent back

986
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,599
uh with you know without applying any

987
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,480
other fungicides

988
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,919
so

989
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,320
you know there's a

990
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,079
definitely an intrinsic value to having

991
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,679
that inner crop growing

992
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,560
um

993
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,639
there with your chickpeas so

994
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,040
the one thing i didn't show here because

995
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,639
it's a pretty boring graph but

996
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,040
uh we actually saw 100 control of white

997
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,839
mold in the one year that we had a big

998
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,240
white mold outbreak in our chickpeas

999
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,639
we had any amount of flex in the plot we

1000
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,119
had zero white mold if we had just

1001
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,800
chickpeas we had substantial white mold

1002
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,920
okay

1003
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,359
so it's a pretty boring graph but

1004
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,880
uh and then of course my biggest

1005
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,880
takeaway is that

1006
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,839
um i think

1007
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,520
in our area 10 pounds an acre of blacks

1008
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,599
is the most i would consider ever

1009
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,960
putting in the system okay

1010
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,960
maybe we need to go even less than that

1011
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,200
and uh i think

1012
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,680
turn it over to claire at this point

1013
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,119
alrighty hello everybody um

1014
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,000
claire keane

1015
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,079
and

1016
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,760
sorry that i'm not there in person um

1017
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,240
hopefully some of you recognize me from

1018
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,040
out in my from my time out in williston

1019
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,040
um

1020
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,920
been here in fargo the last few months

1021
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,000
and

1022
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,839
still adjusting to the new job but very

1023
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,079
happy to be able to share with you some

1024
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,640
data from williston

1025
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:48,000
okay so i'm going to talk about two

1026
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,800
trials uh that i conducted in 2018 and

1027
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,200
2020 at the williston research extension

1028
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,240
center dryland farm

1029
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,720
so these were not done under irrigation

1030
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,520
and um i think

1031
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,640
that was a nice transition from mike um

1032
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,800
in those

1033
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,320
seating rates of flax because what was i

1034
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,920
i was interested

1035
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,240
um you know

1036
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,960
oh gosh three years ago now um when

1037
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,160
starting to do this is you know could i

1038
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,839
identify

1039
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,440
a flax seeding rate that reduced the

1040
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,839
ascochyta blight

1041
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,720
without reducing chickpea yields so that

1042
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,599
was my goal

1043
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,400
in both years i used cdc orion chickpea

1044
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,240
which is a kabuli type and then cdc

1045
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,320
glass flax

1046
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,720
and uh the

1047
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,960
treatments that i used i guess i'll can

1048
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,560
you see the mouse if i move it on the

1049
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,240
screen

1050
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,839
yep you're good okay great so i i had my

1051
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,760
uh treatments

1052
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,720
ranging from monocrop chickpea to

1053
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,599
chickpea with five pounds of flax 10 15

1054
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,720
20 40 pounds of flax and then a monocrop

1055
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:58,320
flax of 40 pounds per acre is a check um

1056
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,160
in percents my kid presented um his data

1057
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,560
in terms of a percent of that full

1058
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,680
seating rate so five pounds of flax

1059
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,160
compared to 40 pounds is 12 and a half

1060
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,599
percent so this is 12 and a half percent

1061
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,200
of the mono crop

1062
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,000
25

1063
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,040
37 and a half percent 50

1064
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,400
and 100

1065
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,200
so just to give you

1066
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,359
um

1067
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,680
that continuity there so i did have some

1068
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,160
of these lower rates included in my

1069
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,160
trials

1070
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,680
i also wanted to point out planting

1071
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,280
configurations and this will

1072
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,720
this will have implications when we get

1073
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,720
into the yield

1074
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,400
but i did use different planters in the

1075
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,040
two years of these studies

1076
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,680
so in 2018 we used an old single row

1077
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,680
planter with 10 inch spacing and on that

1078
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,480
single row planter there's a different

1079
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,720
funnel essentially for each row and so i

1080
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,560
would dump you know packet of flax

1081
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,880
packet of chickpea packet of flax packet

1082
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,839
of chickpea um in the inner crop plots

1083
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,079
or just all chickpea or flax envelopes

1084
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,280
um for the mono crops so what that ended

1085
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,079
up looking like

1086
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,280
was a four row plot of chickpea with

1087
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,160
monocrop

1088
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,240
uh as i mentioned flax chickpea flax

1089
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,440
with the inner crop plot and then mono

1090
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,079
crop flax

1091
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,079
all flax

1092
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,920
and that seeding rate of the monocrop

1093
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,720
chickpea was about 120 pounds per acre i

1094
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,960
was targeting that four plants uh per

1095
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,280
foot of rose so seeding it at about four

1096
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,040
to five seeds per foot

1097
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,359
um

1098
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,119
i didn't uh something that it kind of

1099
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,760
dawned on me like after i planted the

1100
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,760
trial this did result in half as many

1101
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,079
chickpea plants present

1102
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,760
in the inner crop plots as the monocrop

1103
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,480
because i didn't double that seeding

1104
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,440
rate of chickpea in the inner crop so

1105
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,640
functionally the seeding rate in my 2018

1106
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,320
trial was 120 pounds per acre of

1107
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,880
chickpea

1108
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,119
in the mono crop but then 60 pounds per

1109
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,839
acre of chickpea with those different

1110
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:01,520
rates of flax in the inner crop and then

1111
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:04,000
the mono crop at 40 pounds

1112
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,359
and so just a picture of that um you can

1113
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,040
see flax chickpea flax chickpea so that

1114
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:14,320
four row plot and alternating rose

1115
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,920
in 2020 we used a cone cedar and that

1116
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,520
cone seeder

1117
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,480
like we used in many of our variety

1118
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,760
trials

1119
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,000
is designed to be able to do um you know

1120
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,440
different varieties of the same crop

1121
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,119
plot to plot and so it's

1122
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,320
a six row cedar with eight inch spacing

1123
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,160
so

1124
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,160
looking at the mono crop flax that's

1125
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,560
what normally gets planted out of this

1126
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,720
planter is um you have your seeding rate

1127
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,640
and you just put it down the cone cedar

1128
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,560
and away you go

1129
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,800
but to do the chickpea we actually put

1130
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,960
it in the fertilizer box so the chickpea

1131
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,920
was coming out of the banded fertilizer

1132
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,480
tubes

1133
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,960
and so my mono crop chickpea plots were

1134
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,040
three rows of chickpea

1135
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,960
at a 15 inch spacing

1136
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,880
the inner crops

1137
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,440
that chickpea was still coming out in

1138
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,359
that 15 inch spacing but then the 8 inch

1139
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:10,480
spacing of the flax rose on top of it

1140
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,319
and then again that mono crop flax was

1141
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,839
six rows of flax at an eight inch

1142
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,640
spacing

1143
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:18,560
the mono crop chickpea rate was 120

1144
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,079
pounds per acre again

1145
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,920
but because of this different planter

1146
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,160
configuration i was able to keep the

1147
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,119
chickpea seeding rate consistent between

1148
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,599
the mono crop and the inner crops in

1149
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,520
2020 and again

1150
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,760
you know when we get to yield i think

1151
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,319
there's something interesting there to

1152
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,319
mention with

1153
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:44,800
that so 2020 a picture of those plots um

1154
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,920
there's an outer row of flax a row of

1155
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,000
chickpea

1156
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,280
two rows of flax between the next row of

1157
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
chickpea again two rows of flax chickpea

1158
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,400
and then an outer row of flax so

1159
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,119
different configurations between 2018

1160
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,319
and 2020.

1161
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,280
so for effects on ascochytoblite in 2018

1162
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,960
um

1163
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,560
again just remembering that there were

1164
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,200
half as many chickpea plants in the

1165
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,280
inner crops as the mono crop

1166
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,960
um i looked at incidents as the number

1167
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,280
of chickpea plants out of 10 with

1168
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,200
ascochyto blight lesions present so just

1169
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,359
presence or absence from 10 plants

1170
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,480
randomly selected in the plot

1171
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,160
and then severity used a 0 to 10 scale

1172
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,920
oh sorry about that

1173
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,560
with no lesions

1174
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,079
being zero and a rating of 10 meaning

1175
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,400
many lesions present throughout the

1176
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,560
canopy including on upper leaves and

1177
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,359
pods

1178
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,000
and so in 2018

1179
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,640
there were significant differences in

1180
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,760
ascochyta incidents

1181
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,920
at the july 17 sampling date where mono

1182
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,640
crop chickpea had higher incidence than

1183
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,520
intercropping with chickpea and flax

1184
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,280
but noting that even though it was

1185
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,680
statistically similar

1186
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,280
that monocrop chickpea into the vasco

1187
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,440
kaido was higher than all of the

1188
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,359
inner crop combinations

1189
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,720
and on july 31st the severity rating

1190
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,160
again

1191
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,319
with severity being on a 0 to 10 scale

1192
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,760
that mono crop chickpea plot was rated

1193
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,000
at a

1194
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,200
rated at 7.3

1195
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,119
uh which was

1196
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,800
significantly different from

1197
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:30,240
any of the inner crop rates of 10

1198
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,160
15 20 and 40 pounds of flax and then

1199
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,640
that five pounds of flax being similar

1200
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,040
to both the mono crop and those higher

1201
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,640
rates of flax

1202
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,960
and so there wasn't um you know

1203
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,200
obviously a statistical difference at

1204
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,119
every sampling date

1205
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,760
but i do know that

1206
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,960
you know even with um severity and

1207
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,720
incidents of july 17th and 31st again

1208
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,480
that trend of the monocrop chickpea

1209
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,560
having the highest rating

1210
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,200
both in terms of

1211
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,000
severity and incidents is there

1212
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,040
and now 2018 um was a pretty wet year

1213
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,240
for us out at the williston rec

1214
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,160
um we had approximately 9.2 inches of

1215
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,680
rain between may and august so certainly

1216
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,760
one of the better rainfall years we've

1217
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,319
had

1218
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,440
in the last last five

1219
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,280
and then

1220
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,480
we did spray the whole trial with

1221
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,119
fungicide twice so on june 25th and july

1222
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:29,440
12th so all of these treatments did have

1223
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,440
two applications of foliar fungicides

1224
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,160
now in 2020 so again just reminding you

1225
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,160
that there's the same density of

1226
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,839
chickpea plants in the mono crop and the

1227
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,720
inner crop in this year

1228
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,960
i also change my scales um with some

1229
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,200
input from plant pathologists thank you

1230
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,680
audrey uh number of chickpea plants out

1231
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,240
of 20 with ascochyta lesions present so

1232
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,960
again that presence absence um and then

1233
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,200
the severity of a one nine one to nine

1234
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,760
scale i learned that that's a more

1235
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,200
typical scale in uh plant pathology so

1236
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,920
we went with that

1237
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,920
so one meaning no lesions and nine again

1238
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,680
many lesions present

1239
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,480
throughout the canopy and then also with

1240
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,680
wilting or dead plants present

1241
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,560
and so in 2020 we did these ratings july

1242
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,119
1 july 9 july 24

1243
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,160
and the only time we saw a statistically

1244
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:23,760
significant difference was july 24

1245
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:26,720
where on the incidents 15 approximately

1246
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,359
15 out of 20 chickpea plants checked um

1247
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,359
had ascochytal lesions present uh which

1248
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,400
was different from with 10 pounds of

1249
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,040
flax

1250
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,720
roughly 11 and 11 plants with that um

1251
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,880
20 pounds of flax

1252
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,839
um so not a lot of statistical

1253
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,640
differences in 2020 however again that

1254
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,440
trend so on july 1st

1255
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,720
of

1256
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:54,319
more plants and the monocrop chickpea

1257
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,640
plots having ascochyta present then the

1258
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,839
inner crop plots that that was true at

1259
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,920
july 1

1260
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,720
and july 9

1261
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,480
and then severity

1262
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,280
these severity ratings just were not

1263
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,920
very high in 2020 which makes sense in

1264
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,920
light of the the drought that we had so

1265
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,319
still that trend of the monocrop

1266
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,240
chickpea having a more um

1267
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,560
you know more severe nature of that

1268
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,720
infestation but again relative to 2018

1269
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,359
these are pretty low numbers um i'll

1270
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,240
just go back quick you know so reminder

1271
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,920
in 2018 looking at a 10 plants

1272
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,079
by the end of july even with two

1273
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,480
fungicide applications i was seeing

1274
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,720
those monocrop uh plots

1275
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,480
you know 10 out of 10 plants having

1276
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,440
ascochyta present

1277
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,680
um

1278
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,560
but then you go to 2020 and out of 20

1279
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,760
plants you know 15 out of 20 in the mono

1280
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,640
crop

1281
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,440
and down around you know 11

1282
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,680
out of 20 plants in the higher rates of

1283
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,079
flax center crops so very different

1284
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,480
years in terms of moisture

1285
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,160
but i think that that still shows that

1286
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,599
one in a dry year you can still have

1287
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,319
ascochyta

1288
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:05,680
but then two inner cropping while it may

1289
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:08,240
not provide as as high degree as of

1290
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,960
control is in a wetter year

1291
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,119
it's still doing something

1292
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,880
and again just pointing out so in 2020

1293
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:18,000
the growing season rainfall was

1294
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,640
approximately 4.3 inches so half half of

1295
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,440
what it was in 2018 and again this whole

1296
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:27,560
trial did receive fungicide

1297
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,560
three times in 2020.

1298
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,800
um it's something uh

1299
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,400
mike mentioned in his preface that

1300
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,480
intercropping might increase the need

1301
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,800
for desiccation and i do think that's

1302
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,800
true especially with the p

1303
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,640
uh canola combination that'll get talked

1304
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,880
about later

1305
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,520
but just kind of an interesting side

1306
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,599
note um in my conversations with lena

1307
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,119
shaw and some other growers in canada

1308
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,800
you know they had noticed that they felt

1309
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,880
that intercropping chickpea and flax

1310
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,599
generally provided a benefit to chickpea

1311
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,599
dry down that that chickpea or sorry

1312
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,480
having the flax with the chickpea just

1313
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,640
encourage the chickpea to um to shut

1314
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,200
down you know late summer like you want

1315
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,319
it to and start drying down rather than

1316
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:13,119
staying green and continuing to flower

1317
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,280
and so i did dry down ratings each year

1318
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:19,040
and so in 2018

1319
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,280
went out about every 10 days and rated

1320
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,200
the plots for the percent of chickpea

1321
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,000
plants with mature color

1322
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,559
and there were significant differences

1323
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,040
at each of those dates again this was in

1324
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:35,200
a pretty wet year

1325
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,640
and then in 2020 that dry down happens

1326
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,400
with the drought

1327
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,200
certainly much more quickly

1328
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,319
um

1329
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,200
but again

1330
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:45,839
the the trend of those intercropped uh

1331
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:49,040
plots drawing down the chickpea faster

1332
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:51,599
uh really held true and i feel like to

1333
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,559
me and an interesting um

1334
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:57,040
observation in 2018 again um a pretty

1335
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,040
wet growing season you know you start to

1336
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,280
see the spread really widen you know

1337
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,800
functionally the difference between zero

1338
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,040
percent of your chickpea plants with

1339
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,599
mature color on august 2nd

1340
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:11,520
and um hope i keep losing my cursor

1341
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:13,359
there we go and five percent um

1342
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,280
you know doesn't doesn't mean anything

1343
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,480
right and then the difference between 15

1344
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,400
and 30

1345
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,920
you know that spread starting to widen

1346
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,640
but then by the time we get to august

1347
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,160
24th um seeing you know pure chickpea

1348
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,920
and chickpea with five pounds of flax

1349
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:30,000
down at this 60 65 mature color um but

1350
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,680
the chickpea with 20 and 40 pounds up at

1351
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,680
80 percent that's a pretty big

1352
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,440
difference you know that might be

1353
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,760
close to that tipping point of if you

1354
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,640
were going to go out and desiccate um to

1355
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,319
do that and be able to harvest those

1356
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,280
chickpeas potentially a week or two

1357
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,280
earlier

1358
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,280
than you otherwise might have

1359
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:51,680
i think is really important

1360
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,280
um and then in 2020 just with that very

1361
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,040
dry summer

1362
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,400
um you know that

1363
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,559
chickpea was drying down much more

1364
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,040
quickly august 4th we were already at 30

1365
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:04,400
percent mature color and the mono crop

1366
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,040
um compared to about 56

1367
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,520
with the 40 pounds of flax uh so just

1368
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,480
that inner cropping does seem to push

1369
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,839
push that

1370
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,800
chickpea dry down uh more quickly and

1371
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,319
again you know maybe at the production

1372
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,720
scale i'd say we don't we don't have

1373
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,960
good data on that yet um but if this is

1374
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,640
a way that a grower could get into that

1375
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,720
field earlier to harvest those chickpeas

1376
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,480
prevent it from getting rained on next

1377
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,000
week or two weeks from now i think

1378
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,880
that's where there's there's some real

1379
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,599
potential with this

1380
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,640
uh for some photos so these are from

1381
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:41,760
august 14th of 2018. so monocrop

1382
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,359
chickpea here on the left um and i'll

1383
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,920
just point out so there's still quite a

1384
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:48,400
few you know dark green healthy leaves

1385
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,800
doing doing photosynthesis and if you

1386
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,400
see a dead plant or you know what you

1387
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,400
might think of this mature color in that

1388
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,960
mono crop plant

1389
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,520
i would say in nine out of ten cases

1390
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,680
those plants aren't mature color because

1391
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,119
they naturally senesce it's because

1392
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,160
ascochyta

1393
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,640
killed them

1394
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,680
you know a week or more ago and so

1395
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,520
that's what you're seeing in the

1396
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,599
monocrop chickpea plants when you see

1397
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,359
brown

1398
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,400
with the 10 pounds of flax so those

1399
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,480
chickpea rose are here and here

1400
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,480
and then chickpea with 40 pounds of flax

1401
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,800
on the far right um those chickpea

1402
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,720
plants just have many fewer lush green

1403
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,400
leaves they're much more yellow and so

1404
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,319
that's what i was capturing with those

1405
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:34,000
ratings on the earlier slide

1406
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:37,200
from 2020 again with a drought year um

1407
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,359
august 4th so

1408
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,880
chickpea is definitely drying down more

1409
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:44,559
quickly in 2020 than they did in 2018

1410
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,119
but again just looking at those mono

1411
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,079
crop chickpea rose more green present

1412
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,160
there

1413
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,319
with five pounds of flax those chickpea

1414
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,960
rose are starting to get lost in the

1415
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:57,040
yellow flax and then at that 20 pound

1416
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,040
rate of flax

1417
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,200
i'd say the chickpea leaves are getting

1418
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,160
pretty hard to pick out from the

1419
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,720
um

1420
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:09,160
flax stems as they're all

1421
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,160
turning yellow pretty quickly

1422
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,839
um this is a photo taken at harvest of

1423
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,880
2018

1424
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:19,520
so again these are small plots

1425
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:23,680
i did not need to desiccate in either

1426
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,520
2018 or 2020 to be able to harvest these

1427
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,839
so after that last set of ratings we

1428
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,920
waited another five days or so

1429
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:32,240
and went out and with the small plot

1430
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,240
combine it worked there really wasn't

1431
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,760
much green material it was pretty clean

1432
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,760
in terms of weeds

1433
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:42,480
we did use spartan ahead of planting

1434
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,520
and that did a nice job in these fields

1435
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,200
so

1436
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,559
weeds certainly if you have green weeds

1437
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,800
out there that could be an issue that

1438
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,880
needs desiccation

1439
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,319
and i'd say you know it's

1440
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,000
certainly too soon to say whether you

1441
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,160
can get away with desi without

1442
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,640
desiccation in the system um but there

1443
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,040
might be years in which that's possible

1444
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,520
um but again something to to play with

1445
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:06,240
at a field scale if you're a grower

1446
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,240
considering this

1447
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,079
here's a shot of my inner crop straight

1448
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,800
out of the combine

1449
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,720
it to me i mean it did look pretty good

1450
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,960
certainly we had a lot of pieces of

1451
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,880
chickpea pods and straw

1452
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,040
but those separated out very easily with

1453
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,920
the the clipper cleaners that we have at

1454
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,920
the wrec

1455
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,040
so now in terms of yields

1456
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,760
so in 2018

1457
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,720
we

1458
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,040
i did not see over yielding in any year

1459
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,040
so just to put that out there

1460
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,720
um but i do think there were some

1461
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,480
interesting things happening

1462
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,480
with um

1463
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,160
the with both the chickpeas and the flax

1464
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,880
and these different yields so in 2018

1465
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:53,599
um the monocrop chickpea did yield the

1466
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,440
most um the most chickpea of all the

1467
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,920
treatments uh but then certainly the

1468
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,640
most total poundage of

1469
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,680
of grain coming out of the field

1470
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:06,240
so the different letters on these uh

1471
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,480
light beige bars indicate

1472
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,839
statistical differences in the chickpea

1473
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,160
yield

1474
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:14,800
so monocrop chickpea

1475
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,040
5 10 and 15 pounds of flax it did step

1476
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,280
down from the monocrop chickpea we went

1477
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,559
from about 1700 pounds

1478
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,640
per acre down to about 1100 pounds um

1479
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,839
but that was statistically similar to

1480
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,480
the monocrop

1481
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,319
but then also the lower yields of

1482
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,160
chickpea

1483
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:35,040
when it was intercropped with 20 and 40

1484
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:38,640
pounds of flax and so down there it was

1485
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:41,520
roughly 850 and 620 pounds of chickpea

1486
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,839
at these higher inner crops

1487
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,319
and we did see the flax

1488
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:49,119
yields stay kind of similar

1489
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:51,839
at those lower rates of intercropping

1490
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:54,240
but then step up at the higher seeding

1491
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,240
rates

1492
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,319
and something again just to remind you

1493
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:00,319
about like that planting configuration

1494
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,720
um i didn't have plant stand counts

1495
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,319
unfortunately so i don't i don't know

1496
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,400
the mechanism at play here but i do

1497
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:09,680
think it's interesting that even though

1498
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,520
we had half as many chickpea plants in

1499
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,119
these inner crops because they're just

1500
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,800
two rows of chickpea compared to four

1501
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,119
rows over here

1502
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,000
we were getting about two thirds of the

1503
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:23,599
chickpea yield as the monocrop so we're

1504
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,520
getting two thirds the yield with half

1505
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,520
the seeding rate

1506
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:31,040
so i you know

1507
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:33,200
had i had the uh foresight back in 2018

1508
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,359
when i was planning this to put in

1509
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,200
the other set of plots with the same

1510
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:39,359
number of chickpea plants in those two

1511
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,119
rows um i'm really curious to know what

1512
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,720
that would have done but but i think

1513
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,799
that shows maybe there's some potential

1514
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,640
for over yielding you know at the plant

1515
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:48,480
level potentially maybe with that lower

1516
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,440
density of chickpea there they responded

1517
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,359
by um getting bigger producing more pods

1518
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,000
you know but i didn't collect that data

1519
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:59,920
so i'm not sure

1520
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,440
um in 2020 so looking at 2020 um

1521
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,440
definitely

1522
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,119
saw the potential for flax to be much

1523
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,040
more competitive in a dry year than a

1524
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,680
white year i think that's the take home

1525
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,160
of 2020. so overall our yields were

1526
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,000
lower the monocrop chickpea yielded just

1527
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,799
a little bit over a thousand pounds per

1528
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,640
acre and then it did step down

1529
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:22,000
as the flax seeding rate increased so

1530
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,400
even five pounds per acre of flax uh did

1531
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,920
decrease it to about 700 pounds of

1532
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,799
chickpea

1533
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,920
um

1534
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,520
and so

1535
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,000
so there i think the take home message

1536
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,760
is if we're in a real dry situation even

1537
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,440
a very low rate of flax can reduce

1538
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,599
chickpea yield

1539
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,960
but then just you know looking at maybe

1540
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,119
the bright side and certainly a bright

1541
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,240
side and a year where flax is worth 30

1542
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:46,559
bushel um the flax did really really

1543
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,400
well i had to you know kind of do a

1544
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:50,720
double take when i when i was thinking

1545
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:55,440
about it but so our mono crop flax

1546
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:58,079
between 2018 and 2020 um 780 pounds in a

1547
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:01,119
year with nine inches of rain

1548
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,839
oh sorry um about 800 800 pounds per

1549
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,839
acre um in a mono crop flax with nine

1550
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,960
inches of rain in the growing season

1551
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:10,160
uh compared to 780 pounds so very very

1552
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,960
comparable

1553
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,040
and

1554
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,240
excuse me and then that flax again just

1555
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,119
showing its

1556
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,720
drought

1557
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:21,200
hardiness really um stepping up in yield

1558
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:24,640
uh as its seeding rate was increased and

1559
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:27,200
i just noted that between the chickpea

1560
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,319
intercropped with flax at the 40 pound

1561
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,160
rate

1562
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:35,119
between 2018 and 2020 um really just

1563
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,400
kind of flip-flopped which i thought was

1564
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,079
interesting

1565
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,480
so

1566
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,079
okay and so i'll wrap it up here um so

1567
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,599
for the optimal seating rate of flax

1568
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,200
that question you know did we find

1569
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,200
something that can reduce ascochyto

1570
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,400
blight but then also maintain chickpea

1571
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,880
yield

1572
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,520
i think that 10 to 15 pounds of flax

1573
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,480
appears to be kind of that sweet spot to

1574
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,319
balance

1575
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,720
reducing ascochyta pressure with

1576
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:01,599
maintaining chickpea yield however in a

1577
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,359
dry year that could certainly um reduce

1578
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,040
the chickpea yield

1579
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:07,280
five pounds of flax wasn't enough to

1580
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,599
consistently reduce ascochyta while 20

1581
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,520
pounds did consistently reduce chickpea

1582
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,520
compared to the monocrop

1583
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,119
the rate of chickpea dry down if that's

1584
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,720
something you're interested in did seem

1585
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,760
to be a little bit more consistent the

1586
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,680
15 pound rate of flax and higher

1587
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,079
but we do need growers to test if this

1588
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,119
holds true at a production scale

1589
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,200
and then

1590
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:29,440
finally you know again flax is much more

1591
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,720
competitive with chickpea in a dry year

1592
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,559
so just something certainly in the

1593
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,720
western part of the state or eastern

1594
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:38,720
montana uh we need to keep in mind if um

1595
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,119
if that's what the growing season is is

1596
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:44,160
like

1597
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:47,119
uh so with that um we will

1598
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:49,760
um take any questions you have uh myself

1599
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:51,839
mike and audrey are all available for

1600
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,280
your questions well claire i'll kick it

1601
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,400
off with a ques question on my own if

1602
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,760
you don't mind

1603
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,680
so

1604
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,559
if i'm interpreting this correctly in

1605
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,599
the

1606
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,280
2018 trials the row spacing between

1607
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,720
chickpea

1608
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,559
um

1609
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,040
was all the same

1610
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,799
you know across your your inter crop and

1611
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:16,240
mono crop but in

1612
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:18,480
but in 2020 your your row spacing in

1613
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,799
your monocrop

1614
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,400
was greater right you have you had an

1615
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:24,160
increased row spacing

1616
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,319
do you think that that could have played

1617
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,280
a role in the reduction in disease you

1618
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:29,520
saw

1619
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,200
and the less the the reduced difference

1620
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,280
you saw essentially between that

1621
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,480
monocrop and the inner crop given that

1622
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,400
you did have a wide row spacing in your

1623
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,200
monocrop jv

1624
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,280
right right so there were 15 inches

1625
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,160
between chickpea

1626
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:49,760
rose and 20 20 where there whereas there

1627
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:51,839
was only 10 inches between rows and 2018

1628
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,960
but then also i'd say two confounding

1629
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:55,520
factors

1630
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,480
two rows of flax between those two rows

1631
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,640
of chickpea in 2020 versus only one row

1632
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,920
of flax between the rows of chickpea in

1633
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,480
2018

1634
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,040
and then throw on top of it just a much

1635
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:10,319
hotter and drier growing season

1636
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:13,520
um so i think back to your question yes

1637
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:15,520
that wider row spacing um

1638
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:18,640
could could be one of the factors why

1639
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:21,520
just overall severity incidence severity

1640
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:24,400
and incidence ratings were less

1641
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,400
in 2020 than 2018.

1642
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,520
um

1643
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,280
you know but

1644
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:34,319
but i guess i don't i don't have a real

1645
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,079
confidence in whether i would attribute

1646
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:37,920
the overall lower ratings to that

1647
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,760
different planting configuration or just

1648
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:43,520
to that much drier

1649
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:44,799
uh growing growing season

1650
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,400
yeah i'm just thinking maybe you would

1651
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:48,400
have seen a bigger difference between

1652
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,079
the treatments in 2020 if you have been

1653
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,400
on like an eight inch row spacing for

1654
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,079
the mono crop compared to

1655
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,760
those chickpea flax chickpea blocks and

1656
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:57,280
eight inches

1657
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,119
true either way you said that's

1658
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,520
interesting okay so we've got a question

1659
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,960
looks like in the chat

1660
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,880
could you talk about any potential

1661
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,960
benefits or disadvantages to planting

1662
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:10,799
and alternating roads versus planting

1663
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,160
both crops together in the same row

1664
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:15,839
i did

1665
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,839
however you want to take that

1666
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:20,960
and i think uh later on atlanta uh shaw

1667
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,760
has some information that will help with

1668
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,760
that too but i think claire you had some

1669
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,520
you had a more of a comparison for this

1670
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,000
didn't you

1671
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:32,720
i had tried um

1672
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,200
so it ended up being a trial that didn't

1673
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:38,240
work out in 2018

1674
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:40,720
i also tried planting some long strips

1675
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:44,160
of chickpea and flax in either

1676
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:46,079
same rows or alternating rows um

1677
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,920
actually right next door to those plots

1678
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,799
that you saw pictures of

1679
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,000
um

1680
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:52,079
to

1681
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,640
with the goal of tracking ascochyta over

1682
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,480
the season and seeing if the mecstro

1683
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,880
versus the

1684
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:03,359
alternating rows made a difference

1685
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:06,160
and unfortunately we planted that

1686
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:08,799
might have been a week to 10 days later

1687
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,680
i don't really recall

1688
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:13,280
but

1689
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:15,200
we had let's see 2018. yeah we

1690
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,200
2018 my planting conditions were really

1691
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,119
ideal um

1692
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,760
that single row planter is not very

1693
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:24,799
heavy and doesn't really have

1694
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,599
good depth control so when we planted

1695
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:27,680
the

1696
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,599
the trial that you saw data from it all

1697
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:33,839
went in the ground nicely and germinated

1698
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,839
nicely and we had good stands but those

1699
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,599
mixture versus alternating rows that we

1700
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,839
planted next door

1701
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,839
going just a week or ten days later the

1702
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:43,520
surface had dried out enough

1703
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:45,119
that the chickpea just didn't get deep

1704
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,119
enough and so there was a very poor

1705
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,520
chickpea stand there

1706
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:51,440
and i ended up not not collecting data

1707
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,200
on it

1708
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,880
i think

1709
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,720
sorry for rambling but i think i'll

1710
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,760
probably defer to elena who has better

1711
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:04,480
data on that um just to my

1712
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,480
limited observation in 2018 um

1713
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,880
i don't recall

1714
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,880
um

1715
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:14,799
is pronounced differences in ascochyta

1716
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:16,240
between say mono crop chickpea and um

1717
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:18,720
the inner cropped

1718
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:21,039
or sorry

1719
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,319
monocrop chickpea versus

1720
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,480
uh

1721
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:27,200
chickpea and flax either in the same row

1722
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,599
or alternating row in those

1723
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,559
uh strips that i put out

1724
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,559
but

1725
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:35,760
my issue there is there were just very

1726
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:38,240
few chickpea plants in in both places so

1727
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:42,160
i don't really have a good read on that

1728
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:44,640
um my sense is that alternating rose

1729
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,760
would have an advantage for ascochyta

1730
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:49,119
control

1731
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:51,599
again knowing that that row spacing and

1732
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,359
you know if we're

1733
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:56,720
uh

1734
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:59,839
yeah that row spacing can have an impact

1735
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,680
on ascochyta incidents in monocrop

1736
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,280
chickpea than i would expect if you can

1737
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,880
have

1738
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,440
essentially an architecture where you're

1739
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,520
putting lots of barriers between

1740
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,680
chickpea plants so in the case of my

1741
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,599
2020 trial where you have row of

1742
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:16,319
chickpea two rows of flax row of

1743
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:18,319
chickpeas two rows of flax

1744
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:20,000
certainly you know in that same chickpea

1745
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:22,240
row there's there's contact between

1746
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,079
leaves but you're putting barriers there

1747
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,559
side to side that would help limit

1748
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:29,680
physical spread

1749
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:31,839
but i'll i'll certainly um deferred

1750
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,400
elena because i think she's um played

1751
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,760
with that more more than i have

1752
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,039
and i will say you know it is a

1753
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,599
trade-off because

1754
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,880
um you know again when you're doing

1755
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,799
these intercrop tickets you're usually

1756
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,799
picking two crops that have very

1757
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:46,400
different seed sizes and so you know of

1758
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:48,720
course the big advantage of alternating

1759
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,640
is that you can set each row to plant

1760
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,119
the crop exactly where it likes to be

1761
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:55,200
planted when you do a mixed rule

1762
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:56,880
you have to

1763
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,799
do something in between

1764
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,559
in most cases and so you're usually

1765
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:02,400
planting your small seeded crop deeper

1766
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:04,000
than you normally plant

1767
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,760
your big seeded crops shallower than

1768
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,400
your normal implants

1769
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,680
so the conditions have to be

1770
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,400
a little more sensitive when you're

1771
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:14,960
doing the mixed roll

1772
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,559
yeah and mike um there's another

1773
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,920
question in the chat that's a good

1774
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,559
follow-up to that

1775
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,799
a question for mike since you seated in

1776
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:25,200
the same row did you go at the full

1777
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:27,119
chickpea seating depth or shallow up

1778
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,839
somewhere in between

1779
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:31,599
so yeah when we do our chickpea flax um

1780
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:33,039
i think we usually target about an inch

1781
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,119
and a quarter

1782
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,640
um and then

1783
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:38,319
when we do our field peak canola we

1784
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,559
usually put it right around an inch or

1785
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:42,559
maybe just slightly more

1786
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:45,119
and you know usually we've found that

1787
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:47,200
the smaller seeded crop comes up easier

1788
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,559
if it's in the mixture because

1789
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,400
you know it does have that large seeded

1790
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,880
crop to help it get out of the ground so

1791
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,680
you do have some synergy there

1792
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,520
but

1793
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,280
you know

1794
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,720
if you're worried about the moisture

1795
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,599
conditions though

1796
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,119
um

1797
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:03,119
you know and you have different things

1798
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:05,599
to plant i would definitely be planting

1799
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,640
your mixtural inner crop at the right

1800
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:12,839
timing for what your soil moisture is

1801
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,839
i would say that much at least
