1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,120
innovation platforms are a way to bring

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,200
people with different experiences

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,960
together for common action in this case

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,160
they work together on natural resource

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,760
management and improve livelihood in

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,480
nile basin development challenge there

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,920
are three action research locations gel

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,760
to erada

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,560
for garage and

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,440
de garda in innovation platforms we try

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,000
to bring together stakeholders

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,480
we have communities represented

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,320
from each catalyst

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,559
there are university

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,120
research centers

16
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,960
and development agents

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,280
and also some farmers

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,680
we set up these innovation platforms to

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,879
build their own capacities we try to

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,360
minimize

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,120
the gap and that will improve their

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,399
linkage network

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,640
coordination

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,600
and we want them to learn one from each

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,600
other

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,760
after we identified the different

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,360
stakeholders we established innovation

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,520
platforms through sending them offshore

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,280
letters and they came to our first

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,400
innovation platform

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,240
we bring them about our objective in

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,240
terms of innovation platforms what we

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,159
want to achieve with them

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,159
we brought an issue of

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,640
what their roles could be

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,360
and together we have identified a term

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,960
of reference after we

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,960
did the first we came to the second

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,159
innovation platform with the objective

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,320
of identifying prioritizing

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,479
the main issues of rainwater management

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,840
or natural resource management because

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,680
the communities were not fully

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,000
represented in our innovation platform

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,880
members we decided to do some community

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,280
engagement activities we did a focus

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,759
group discussion we did a participatory

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,360
video in fogara through all these

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,240
engagement activities we try to

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,799
prioritize with communities what

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,799
real issues they have on the ground

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,640
so after we bring what they have

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,520
prioritized in each site to the

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,720
innovation platforms we present both

55
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,640
side by side and try to prioritize from

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,920
the communities and as well as from

57
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,160
experts all scientists have selected

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,239
forage intervention as an entry point to

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,560
deal with their big main issues which is

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,920
different in the three sides if you take

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,480
digka the guy is having a problem with

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,879
termites where these natural resource

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,440
managements are being damaged the forage

64
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,760
development was introduced because there

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,120
are some forage species that

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,360
resists also thermite infestation and in

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,319
gel 2 we have land degradation the

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,319
island is really degraded and the soil

69
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,720
productivity is very less if we

70
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,720
introduce these forage developments that

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,239
will complement the current

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,040
national campaign of soil and water

73
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,599
conservation so with that we can improve

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,920
something on land degradation

75
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,599
if you ask me about the fogarakis the

76
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,239
big issue is free grazing land is

77
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,959
degraded they are running out of forage

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,640
so that is direct implication in terms

79
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,280
of our intervention

80
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,159
on each innovation platform meetings we

81
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,400
plan together for joint action in terms

82
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,200
of when to plant what kinds of forage

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,519
trees we need to plant and when who is

84
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,519
going to do what they have also come up

85
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,319
with some technical groups who will

86
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,319
follow up in between the regular

87
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,920
innovation platform meetings during

88
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,720
planning

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,840
we try to do this action research in

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,519
small farmers and they give them an

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,599
awareness creation if they are

92
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,920
successful with these farmers they are

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,599
going to scale it up with other farmers

94
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,000
they will also promise them to

95
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,400
demonstrate field days if they are going

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,560
to be successful with this there are a

97
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,319
lot of problems that we encounter the

98
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,400
time that we had in nail base and

99
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,720
development challenge is too short

100
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,720
because innovation platform

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,799
is set up not only for

102
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,519
trying something out on the ground but

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,840
also with behavioral change when you set

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,040
platforms where there is no that kind of

105
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,799
experience

106
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,560
they can't see the impacts that

107
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,120
innovation platforms will bring to their

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,360
world within a short period of time

109
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,879
the other is also last year we face a

110
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,680
problem in terms of training and

111
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,759
participatory approach so we provide

112
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,919
trainings for innovation platform

113
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,880
members on innovation platform

114
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,440
facilitation skills and on participatory

115
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,199
research methods this year we devolve

116
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,160
the roles and responsibilities to our

117
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,240
local partners they are managing the

118
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,800
innovation platform meetings in a way

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,960
that we can give them a good training

120
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,840
come up with a good lesson in one

121
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,759
specific site with one issue so that we

122
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,759
can scale it up to other sites

123
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,320
you
