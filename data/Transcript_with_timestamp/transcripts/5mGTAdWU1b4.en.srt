00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
hi this is jonathan rotz field

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,520
agronomist pioneer i'm back here today

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,680
in this same cover crop field that we

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,000
had earlier and you can see it's still

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,320
green and growing now some folks may say

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,160
that a cover crop this size is way too

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,759
big to worry about planting through and

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,240
there are some challenges that come

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,680
along with it but just as a lot of

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,439
producers that i work with have found

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,960
out there are ways to get through this

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,279
and there's actually some benefits down

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,439
the road as well more on that in some

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,439
later videos cover crops have a lot of

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,160
benefits including soil preservation

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,840
carbon sequestration increased organic

17
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,239
matter in soils

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,360
both nutrient creation and retention and

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,680
many more

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,600
however as we try to maximize some of

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,840
these benefits we can also create

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,399
management challenges for the crop this

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,480
first challenge we meet in the spring is

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,399
at planting time this video will

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,840
highlight how some producers are working

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,960
to manage through some of these

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,800
challenges

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,360
the first challenge we come to is simply

29
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,120
planting through this amount of biomass

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,800
as discussed last time some of this

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,640
starts in the fall by not planting your

32
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,199
cover crop very heavy to make sure that

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,280
biomass is manageable about one bushel

34
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,280
of small grain is enough

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,920
many producers who have adopted planting

36
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,320
into large cover are also using some

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,560
form of rolling to lay the cover down

38
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,479
before or at planting

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,119
these rollers not only push the cover

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,439
down but they also crimp the cover

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,000
this helps so that the cover crop will

42
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,840
not stand back up as well as starting

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,920
the process of decomposition and

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,079
nutrient release by keeping the cover

45
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,079
crop in contact with the soil

46
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,200
in this scenario this crop was sprayed

47
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,799
with herbicide just prior to rolling

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,040
the next part is to make sure that your

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,119
planter is set up to not wrap the cover

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
crop while still making a good zone for

51
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,159
the seed to be planted into including

52
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,079
proper closing of the seed trench

53
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,840
many options are available for planters

54
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,680
that can work in these scenarios but

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,439
discussing these options with others who

56
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,479
are having success is a great place to

57
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,240
start

58
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,320
when planting into cover crops either

59
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,880
make sure the crop is dead and somewhat

60
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,479
dry or live and growing

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,240
these are the two best ways to manage

62
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,319
the cover crop so your planter does not

63
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,200
have issues cutting through the cover

64
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,200
creating hair pinning in the furrow

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,520
when a cover crop is in the process of

66
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,319
dying it can be hard to cut through

67
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,480
of course planting into cover is also no

68
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,760
different than any other planting that

69
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,160
you must make sure that the soil is dry

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,080
many have found that a live active

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,319
growing cover crop will actually help

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,200
pull moisture out of the soil whereas a

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,800
dead cover will keep soils wet once the

74
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,040
cover crop is rolled and planted through

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,680
you now have a nice mat of biomass that

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,519
will keep soil moisture in as well as

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,840
help to compete with weeds

78
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,760
this biomass will break down over time

79
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,720
re-releasing nutrition to the growing

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,200
crop

81
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,720
now interestingly enough right between

82
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,800
these two fields we're seeing some

83
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,519
differences in some cover crops this is

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,519
mainly due to both species and planting

85
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,920
date but it brings up the interesting

86
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,640
observation of what happens whenever we

87
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,640
have different sizes of cover crops and

88
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,280
this all comes back to general agronomy

89
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,599
and carbon to nitrogen ratios as we get

90
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,599
larger and larger cover we have more

91
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,040
stem elongation and more of those

92
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,280
proteins are put into the head

93
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,519
production as well as grain this means

94
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,319
we're going to have a lower nitrogen or

95
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,400
a higher carbon to nitrogen ratio this

96
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,519
will be slower to die and decompose over

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,360
the year

98
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,840
smaller covers on the other side will

99
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,720
have higher carbon to nitrogen and will

100
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,519
be quicker to disappear throughout the

101
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,239
year again we'll see more about this on

102
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,920
later videos this mat of material is a

103
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,920
good thing but it can also make it

104
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,200
difficult to get nitrogen to the growing

105
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,840
crop early on as it breaks down

106
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
because it has a lot of carbon to

107
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,879
decompose because of this i like to have

108
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,640
a significant amount of nitrogen put

109
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,640
down with the planter into the soil

110
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,159
below the cover crop to carry the crop

111
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,840
to side dress time

112
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,080
although planting through large cover

113
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,080
may not be for everyone i hope that this

114
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,239
has at least highlighted how some are

115
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,480
making it work i hope this video has

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,080
given you some things to consider if you

117
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,599
are thinking about changing your cover

118
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,280
cropping practices

119
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,280
as always talk to those who are already

120
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,280
doing this to get some tips and tricks

121
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,439
and when trying different things start

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
in small stages to see what's best for

123
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,799
your operation

124
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
thanks for your time and i hope you

125
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,400
found this video informative and helpful

126
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,160
we'll continue to return to this

127
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,160
operation and field to highlight some of

128
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,240
the benefits we can see with cover crops

129
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,199
throughout this season so keep an eye

130
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,759

131
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,440
