1
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:28,330
as I started to get more and more

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:31,029
interested in how Erie's work the the

3
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:35,020
first class research varietal

4
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:37,210
improvement agronomy engineering all of

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,890
this how this could be more relevant to

6
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,350
different countries particularly

7
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,210
countries that had I would say have been

8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,460
bypassed by the Green Revolution that

9
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,110
hadn't really taken off to the same

10
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,879
degree for a number of reasons partly

11
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,090
because of their environment because

12
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:56,890
they were largely rain-fed areas but but

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:59,350
also because of conflict and that's what

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,130
got me interested in the Indochina

15
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,130
region

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:14,150
January 1986 I was invited by dr.

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:17,540
swaminathan to be part of a team that

18
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:21,050
went to to Cambodia then known as

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,090
Kampuchea and it was good if cush it was

20
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:27,050
Don Pak region myself and so we went

21
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,730
there for about 10 days in January 86 it

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,980
had been a request from the Ministry of

23
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:34,280
Agriculture it initially actually come

24
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,710
from some NGOs working in Cambodia they

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,050
wanted eariy they were asking eariy to

26
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,700
return some of the seeds that we had in

27
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,500
the gene bank they were interested in

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:47,119
getting the rice industry up and running

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:50,630
again after a long period of great

30
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:53,360
disruption actually to the rice farming

31
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,150
in the country so we went on in that in

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,560
that first mission and and lots of

33
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,979
interesting things came of that as a

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,979
result

35
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:06,500
i-it's a it's it's it's a remarkable

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,539
story and and one that you know I wish I

37
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:13,040
wish more people knew about that because

38
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:16,310
it is such a compelling example of how

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,250
genetic conservation is is so critical

40
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,890
particularly you know for countries like

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,959
Cambodia that are so reliant on

42
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,840
agriculture and in this case so reliant

43
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,150
on rice production so Cambodia you know

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:34,370
has one would call it a quite a

45
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:37,280
checkered history it leading up to the

46
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,110
end of the Vietnam War actually the

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,510
country was very productive

48
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,319
not necessarily high-yielding but they

49
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:48,410
were generating surpluses of rice from

50
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:53,120
Cambodia leading up to about you know 70

51
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:55,010
to 73 as the Vietnam War was sort of

52
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,970
coming to an end but it was spilling

53
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:01,250
over into into Cambodia and Laos and so

54
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,980
at one point are sort of in the late 60s

55
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,579
the the country had an area of around

56
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,410
two and a half million hectares of rice

57
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:11,959
and they were actually exporting small

58
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,569
amounts of that to other parts of the

59
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,989
world particularly to Africa actually

60
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:21,980
but as the war spilled over and there

61
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:24,950
was a very strong anti-government

62
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,989
movement going on in the rural areas

63
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,930
more and more people more and more

64
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:33,470
Cambodians actually fled the countryside

65
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:36,200
and made their way into pen on pen and

66
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,120
they sought refuge there actually so the

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,220
population of the city increased from

68
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,569
half a million to about two million

69
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,760
people and at the same time the area

70
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:50,419
planted to rice decreased and decreased

71
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,030
in decreased large areas were affected

72
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:56,569
by land mines as the conflict was going

73
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,970
on so Cambodia went from being a net

74
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,090
surplus country to being a country that

75
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,530
really couldn't feed itself because

76
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,060
everybody or at least a big proportion

77
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,480
of the population were huddled into the

78
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,480
cattles

79
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:18,560
so that sort of led us up to 1975 and I

80
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:22,220
think it was sometime in April 75 the

81
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,790
Khmer Rouge actually took over the

82
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,990
government

83
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:31,430
so the Lawndale government disappeared

84
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:33,290
and then we had a period of three and a

85
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,650
half almost four years of what's known

86
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:39,260
as The Killing Fields so the Khmer Rouge

87
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:43,160
came in with a very I would call it

88
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:45,620
unorthodox but also brutal approach to

89
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,160
development and their view was we needed

90
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,880
to bring the whole country back to Year

91
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,610
Zero and the way to do that in order to

92
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,820
rid the country of all the ills that

93
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:01,220
they saw had affected Cambodia over the

94
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,560
years they the first thing they did was

95
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,690
actually remove everybody from pen on

96
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,010
pen so here we are we have two million

97
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:12,710
people essentially plotted into the city

98
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:14,630
within a few weeks of the arrival of the

99
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:19,450
Khmer Rouge the population went down to

100
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,450
10,000 imagined from 2 Millions 10,000

101
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,760
and so where did they send they

102
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,130
basically redistributed them all over

103
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,310
the country and not necessarily back to

104
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,530
the places where they came from part of

105
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,170
the ideology of the Khmer Rouge and it

106
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:37,440
was a very interesting one as they they

107
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:42,000
recognized that Cambodia's rice was

108
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,590
important okay but they wanted to

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,220
modernize it and their idea of

110
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:51,420
modernization was to irrigate rice and

111
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:54,590
to be the sort of base somehow loosely

112
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:57,870
based the concept on the old anchor

113
00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:00,810
civilization large grids of irrigation

114
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,990
canals and so that sort of you can now

115
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,650
sort of conjure up those images in the

116
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,540
killing fields of very large numbers of

117
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:12,240
essentially slave laborers out there

118
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:15,150
digging ditches and trying to create

119
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,550
irrigation canals the idea was somehow

120
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:20,640
and they were at that time they had

121
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,620
Chinese advisors the the Chinese

122
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,370
government had supported the Khmer Rouge

123
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,740
and the idea there were even introducing

124
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,620
rice varieties from China to plant in

125
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,900
these areas but with hindsight now

126
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,030
looking at all that the the the the

127
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,600
engineering was was extremely faulty

128
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:42,330
very little of that irrigation that

129
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,730
infrastructure ever led to any increase

130
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,620
in irrigated rice production and they

131
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,960
abandoned in fact the Khmer Rouge

132
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,520
actually outlawed deep water rice they

133
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,320
didn't allow farmers to plant this

134
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,640
traditional deep water rice they used to

135
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,680
plant around the Tonle Sap Lake and so

136
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,310
over that period production went right

137
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,020
down to less than less than a million

138
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,610
tons even half a million tonnes I've

139
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,320
seen some of the statistics during that

140
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,910
period which was way less than you

141
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,500
needed to feed a population

142
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,750
notwithstanding the fact that the Khmer

143
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,330
Rouge actually killed upwards of two

144
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:21,960
million people over that period you know

145
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:24,410
one of the greatest genocides in in in

146
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,410
human history

147
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:33,639
so this went on for you know for three

148
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:40,059
and a half four years finally in January

149
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:43,999
79 the Vietnamese came into Cambodia and

150
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:46,789
installed a new government they removed

151
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:48,289
the Khmer Rouge partly because the

152
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,819
government the Cambodian government the

153
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:51,919
Khmer Rouge government was launching

154
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:55,189
attacks on Vietnam and Vietnam of course

155
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:58,509
was a much more powerful force and at

156
00:07:55,189 --> 00:08:01,669
that time also I think China had also

157
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:03,919
reduced and eventually not supported the

158
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,629
Khmer Rouge because Vietnam and had its

159
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,550
battles with China on the northern front

160
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:12,169
as well anyway so Vietnam comes back in

161
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:14,860
installs a new government led by Hun Sen

162
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:19,849
who is still the leader to this very day

163
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:22,519
that was 79 and slowly NGOs sort of

164
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:25,669
trickled into the country no UN because

165
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:27,529
for many years that government was

166
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:30,769
considered illegitimate because it had

167
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:32,599
been installed by a an occupation force

168
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:36,409
the Vietnamese had come in and removed

169
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:38,149
the Khmer Rouge so all along even the

170
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:42,800
time when eery ultimately started

171
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:45,139
working in Cambodia the the Khmer Rouge

172
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,930
actually occupied the seat in the UN and

173
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:50,660
so there was no UN presence in fact all

174
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,189
through this period that we worked in

175
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,220
the early days that we worked there

176
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:57,470
the only governments that recognized the

177
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:01,370
Hun Sen government at that time were the

178
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:04,600
with a Soviet the Soviet Union and the

179
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:07,370
Soviet bloc countries including Cuba and

180
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,779
one other country one that was not in

181
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,420
that sphere of influence and that was

182
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,399
India okay so you had all of the Soviet

183
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,959
bloc but no Western governments

184
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,540
recognized the government in Cambodia

185
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,959
including Australia did not as well so

186
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:24,259
anyway we actually several years passed

187
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,060
and then when we were invited in finally

188
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:28,850
dr. swaminathan received the invitation

189
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:32,630
we went into the country at that point

190
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:35,540
this is early 1986 production had crept

191
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:38,240
back up to about two million tons yields

192
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,470
were still very low but just land area

193
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,470
expansion as the

194
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,660
some of the problems had been sort of

195
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,920
solved in terms of security it wasn't

196
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,020
completely secure and they're still

197
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,760
landmines everywhere which seriously

198
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,610
affected agriculture and particularly

199
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,080
rice farming people as well as animals

200
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,750
were being blown up by stepping on

201
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,620
landmines but anyway there was a bit of

202
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,620
an increase in production

203
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:08,810
so the erie program came in and we we

204
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,760
looked around and and we were we were

205
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:13,339
shocked i would say in that first

206
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,950
mission we we couldn't quite believe

207
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:18,200
what we saw or we'd heard not a lot of

208
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:21,140
information came out to the outside

209
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,000
world during that Khmer Rouge period but

210
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,560
we started to talk to people we started

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,740
to talk to the government officials we

212
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,870
started to talk to everyday folks this

213
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,339
was a hard-line communist government by

214
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,610
the way that we were dealing with back

215
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:36,260
then anyway but they did realize we have

216
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,390
to feed our people right we have to

217
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,720
increase production they had that idea

218
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:43,850
so we said okay let's let's take a look

219
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,890
at who we can work with and you know

220
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,990
like we typically work with a national

221
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,000
research organization right they became

222
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,760
our partners you look around Cambodia

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,620
all the buildings were destroyed

224
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,649
everything had been destroyed we've got

225
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,660
some great photos from that era of what

226
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:03,420
were formerly research institutions in

227
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:07,320
the 70s totally flattened

228
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:11,440
where are the people there were 400

229
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:14,230
trained agriculturalists in the country

230
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,590
prior to the war after the war there

231
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:20,230
were 40 so you had a literal decimation

232
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:23,800
of the aggregate the skilled

233
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,960
agricultural expertise people who had

234
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,760
worked in extension or Ministry of

235
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,080
Agriculture and and and in the

236
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,600
university and so on

237
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,250
so there were very few people available

238
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,220
to work with in fact one of the things

239
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,350
we did before we went to Cambodia was

240
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,089
Erie used to have this book I don't know

241
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,190
if you still have this now where you

242
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:45,910
could they have little photographs of

243
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:48,190
all the Erie trainees going back for

244
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,320
years right and so we looked at Cambodia

245
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,960
to see who'd done a training course at

246
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,570
Erie actually they'd only been six who

247
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,029
there were six faces and six names there

248
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,279
but we brought this with us and we

249
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:02,140
started asking around everybody we saw

250
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,850
you know of course the first thing we

251
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,770
tried to do is so who has a connection

252
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,260
to Erie here that we could start to work

253
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,000
with and we could only we didn't

254
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,460
actually physically locate them but we

255
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,520
only heard of two of those six still

256
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,589
still alive right so they've really been

257
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,520
wiped out the human resources the

258
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:23,170
physical infrastructure wiped out and

259
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:26,470
the varieties were lost as well because

260
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:28,060
with all that dislocation with the fact

261
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,010
that everybody moved from the

262
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:33,550
countryside and then they went through

263
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:36,580
this horrendous period of you know work

264
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,170
slave camps basically and also being

265
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,540
told you can't plant this they bought a

266
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,589
rice and and people were so hungry they

267
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,660
ate their rice seeds right so you

268
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:49,030
basically lost so much of the genetic

269
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,890
resources the the rice genetic resources

270
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:54,160
which were essential in Cambodia because

271
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:58,209
85% of the fields were were rain fed and

272
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,160
so Erie's impact up into that point had

273
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:02,080
been very much focused in the irrigated

274
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,240
and rain fed and favorable rain fed

275
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,850
lowlands had very little impact on the

276
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,070
on the sort of more harsher environments

277
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,700
so all these traditional varieties in

278
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:15,310
Cambodia had evolved under these harsh

279
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,550
conditions but appeared to have been

280
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,550
lost

281
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:26,100
however we have a good news story and

282
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,720
the good news story was that luckily

283
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,570
while probably more than luck very

284
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,450
strategically Erie had sent in some

285
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,670
collectors I don't personally know the

286
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:40,330
names who actually did this but I

287
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:42,670
believe it was 72 and 73 just towards

288
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:45,400
the period where the production and the

289
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,950
you know the turmoil began there had

290
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,190
been a collection of rice varieties

291
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:54,130
traditional rice varieties and I believe

292
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,350
over 750 varieties probably more than

293
00:13:54,130 --> 00:14:00,360
that were actually collected and stored

294
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:03,190
in the e regime back so we did our

295
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,860
checks on we called up the folks in the

296
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,600
gene bank and we found out that yes

297
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,520
indeed we've got all these varieties

298
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,490
that were collected at that point about

299
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,070
13 or 14 years previously they'd live

300
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:18,550
safely in the gene bank while this

301
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:21,850
horrendous you know genocide civil war

302
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:25,300
was going on in Cambodia so over a

303
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:27,340
period of several years part of the URI

304
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,530
program in Cambodia was actually to

305
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,210
reintroduce those varieties and we had

306
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:35,620
one plant we had a couple of plant

307
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:38,710
breeders there Ram Chaudhary edwin

308
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,470
javier and they worked on reintroduction

309
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:43,990
of these traditional varieties and many

310
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,030
of those varieties then farmers you know

311
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,330
grabbed them went with them multiplied

312
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:51,160
them so we had a sort of a two pronged

313
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,650
process or a two pronged approach one

314
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,990
was to get these traditional ones back

315
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:58,360
into places where they best fitted the

316
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,820
other part was where we've got irrigated

317
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,360
rice and we still had 15% of the country

318
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,940
maybe a little more irrigated let's get

319
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,850
state-of-the-art modern IR varieties in

320
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,610
their IR 36 and so on like that had gone

321
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,830
very well in other parts of Asia had

322
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,480
still not found their way at least not

323
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,310
good quality seeds of those varieties

324
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,140
had found their way into Cambodia so had

325
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:23,680
these two things going at once so we

326
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,870
then saw a big yeah well it wasn't big

327
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,960
to start with it was slight let's say a

328
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:31,980
slow improvement in production that has

329
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:35,220
continued you know to this very day

330
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:39,930
so so the varietal improvement part of

331
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,330
it was was very important I can't

332
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:44,760
underestimate the importance of the

333
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:48,120
human resources and as I mentioned the

334
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,770
human resources had been decimated as a

335
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,270
result of the war people that either

336
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,790
been killed or they'd fled as refugees

337
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:56,370
and and disappeared off the map as far

338
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,640
as Cambodia was concerned so a major

339
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:03,090
initial focus of our work was on

340
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:05,010
capacity building so this wasn't easy

341
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,270
because virtually nobody they spoke

342
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,980
English

343
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:11,220
so one of the first things we did was

344
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:15,540
actually bring a group of Cambodians to

345
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:18,000
Erie and I believe it was sometime in 87

346
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,270
that we brought this group of 13

347
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,510
Cambodians from Cambodia to Erie this

348
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,680
was the largest group of Cambodians ever

349
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,920
to leave the country

350
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,560
remember nobody actually well it's a

351
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,620
ever to leave the country other than to

352
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,970
the Soviet Union or other sort of parts

353
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,400
of the world that were friendly with

354
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,860
Cambodia at that time so we brought the

355
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,470
13 of we organized to bring them to to

356
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,440
Erie and we brought them for five months

357
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,390
of training we we had a special rice

358
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,320
production training course everything

359
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:55,790
had to be translated into Khmer and what

360
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,980
they did was in the mornings they did

361
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:02,900
rice production and in the afternoons

362
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:08,130
they did English training so we had the

363
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:09,630
the training center of Erie I'll have

364
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,430
them out in the field planting rice

365
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,200
doing all the physical stuff while it

366
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:16,350
wasn't raining and in the afternoon they

367
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,970
came in and we had a woman Jill Sullivan

368
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:20,190
we we brought her in and she taught

369
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,050
English sort of English for beginners

370
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,460
and so this went on for five months and

371
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,260
these people went back to Cambodia and

372
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,840
we ended up being able to work with them

373
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,190
so parallel with sort of improvements

374
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,220
and technical assistance and all the

375
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:35,220
rest was building up this capacity and

376
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:39,630
over you know a period of about 12 15

377
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:42,330
years or so about 6,000 Cambodians were

378
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,890
trained by Erie at all levels many of

379
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,670
them of course were trained in country

380
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,890
and at one point we had a team

381
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:51,400
about five or six eerie scientists

382
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:53,140
working there but many of them we you

383
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,940
know we brought them back to Erie we

384
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,040
sent them to other we sent them on tours

385
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,510
they got to see other parts of the world

386
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,820
where we'd actually made good progress

387
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,130
in rice production and some of them then

388
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,850
went on to get master's degrees and even

389
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,850
PhDs

390
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,860
so we look at Cambodia today we helped

391
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,360
set up the cambodian Agricultural

392
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,260
Research & Development Institute called

393
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,840
car D we did that very early in the

394
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,910
piece and then we worked very closely to

395
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,790
build up national capacity from scratch

396
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:27,400
physical infrastructure as well as the

397
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,840
human resources to go with it and we

398
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,700
with support from the Australian

399
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,010
government we were able to send quite a

400
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,020
large number of students off for

401
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,180
Advanced Education to do masters and

402
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,890
PhDs mostly in Australia some of them

403
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,440
did it here in the Philippines as well

404
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:44,530
and to this day if you go and look at

405
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,660
the organizational chart of of car D and

406
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:50,140
you look at it over the last several

407
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:52,120
years the people who were running the

408
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,340
organization the the current director

409
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,290
for example Makara has his PhD in

410
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,570
Australia is one of our counterparts one

411
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:01,360
of the trainees and many others in the

412
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,400
organization leading breeding and soils

413
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,680
and entomology and so on all came

414
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,140
through this eerie partnership that was

415
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,940
supported mainly by Australia over those

416
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,940
period of a you know a couple of decades

417
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:19,150
so that's the that's sort of the history

418
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,710
in terms of what we did it I took a lot

419
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,600
about varieties but we worked on

420
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:26,070
agronomy we worked on integrated pest

421
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,810
management post-harvest technology

422
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:31,510
mechanization all of these things were

423
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:33,460
going on at the same time over a you

424
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,100
know rather a long period and you know I

425
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,260
I look at it when when we went in in

426
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,810
January 86

427
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:44,380
the production in the country was around

428
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:47,620
2 million tons the average yield was

429
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:51,550
just over 1 ton per hectare and I look

430
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:54,970
at it today what is it almost 30 years

431
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:57,580
later right total production in the

432
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,860
country is is around 9 million

433
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,260
all right the country is an exporter

434
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,390
again in fact for the last several years

435
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,790
the country has been exporting somewhere

436
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,920
around 800,000 to a little over a

437
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:12,280
million tons per year they've really

438
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:16,000
developed their export export of Rice's

439
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:18,790
as a source of income the you know the

440
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,220
area has gone back to above the level it

441
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:23,980
was even before the war from about two

442
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,140
and a half million hectares having gone

443
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,790
down to half a million now back up to

444
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,980
three million hectares so it hasn't

445
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,200
greatly expanded much of the improvement

446
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,670
has come through yield increases so the

447
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,130
yield is now around three million three

448
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:38,770
three tons per hectare which is you know

449
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:41,440
it doesn't it's not that good perhaps

450
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,690
compared to Vietnam or Indonesia but

451
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,300
you've got to remember that still that

452
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,190
country is largely rain fed irrigation

453
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,290
has expanded investments have expanded

454
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,990
but to be able to get three tonnes per

455
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:56,080
hectare of land that is principally

456
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,460
rain-fed means that you know a lot has

457
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,110
gone into the improvement of crop

458
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:04,930
production so I think it's a great you

459
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:08,350
know Cambodia itself is a great credit

460
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:12,030
to Yuri and I think initially the vision

461
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:16,180
of director-general dr. Swaminathan and

462
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:20,100
consistent long-term partnership with

463
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:23,470
with that country through thick and thin

464
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,840
challenges of funding for the most part

465
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,580
Australia was the was the big supporter

466
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,330
but we were able over the years to

467
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:34,000
diversify that level of support and one

468
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,520
of the key successes is we've been able

469
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,230
to connect Cambodian scientists with

470
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,880
scientists in other countries we always

471
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,560
wanted that we didn't we didn't want

472
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,690
them to be dependent only on area with

473
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,080
the Lao with the Vietnamese with the

474
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,550
Indonesians with the Chinese again and

475
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,190
build those sort of collegial

476
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,980
relationships which would give you know

477
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,620
give strength to the to the national

478
00:21:53,980 --> 00:22:01,180
research system so that's that's

479
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:03,580
basically the Cambodia story I think

480
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,740
that that is actually a really good

481
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:09,130
lesson which by the way I've shared with

482
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,690
a number of other you know colleagues in

483
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,140
other parts of the world as far away as

484
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,480
Africa

485
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:17,740
you know that when we see countries

486
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,840
coming out of conflict we we you know I

487
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:24,309
think we can take some lessons from from

488
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:27,309
what happened in Cambodia I've tried to

489
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:30,809
have sort of similar approaches being

490
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:33,160
used in in in East Timor into molestor

491
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:36,460
again a country coming out of conflict

492
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,530
it's not it's not a predominantly rice

493
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,809
growing area but but I think the general

494
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:43,179
principle when you come out of conflict

495
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:44,169
you've you've often got minimal

496
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:46,540
infrastructure

497
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:50,260
you've got very limited human resources

498
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:53,020
and you you often need to borrow

499
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:56,049
technology and build up research

500
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:58,179
capacity yourself so we've looked at

501
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:59,530
that in timor-leste we looked at that in

502
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:01,510
Mozambique I know here he's now working

503
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:04,049
in Mozambique I think doing a very

504
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:06,450
similar approach improving varieties

505
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:09,130
building national capacity and

506
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,290
strengthening national institutions it's

507
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,270
a good model and I think it it should be

508
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,100
shared more widely and it's probably

509
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,230
going to be very relevant to Afghanistan

510
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,760
and and perhaps some other parts of the

511
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,230
world in the years ahead

512
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,590
not just for rice but for any crop

513
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,590
nation

514
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,080
you
