  "text": "[Music] over the years demand for rice has been growing or into increased demand for alternative carbohydrates and progressive change in eating habits in 2019 kenya imported rice worth 25 billion shillings the annual rice consumption is increasing at a rate of 12 percent compared to four percent for wheat and one percent for maize which is a main step of food previously regarded as an orphan crop the government declared rice an important crop to supplement maize and in 2008 launched the kenyan national rice development strategy to double rice production in the country as the demand for rice increases farmers are becoming more aware of the environment farmers like dan from west corner irrigations came in western kenya and gare from moya irrigation scheme in eastern kenya have been growing rise for decades initially my father is the one who was holding these farms after he was dead he has died i'm the one who took over from him i have four acreage of farm and i'm doing rice when this rise this farm was budging the production of rice was the hill was very high and we one acre was producing almost 60 to 70 bucks but nowadays it goes down i've been a rice farmer for quite a long time i inherited these farms from my father who was a the original roti and i've grown here since i was young and i've been doing this together with my father then i took over i've done it for several years we plan to rise around august we harvest late november and december then after that we do what we call ratoon latune is a when when we cut the rice another crop sprouts and we treat it just like a normal crop and then it grows we harvest then after that our farms remain idle for quite some time before we embark on the next cropping season these farmers are just a sneak peek into what other rice farmers have been practicing for many years globally rice is known to be a key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change owing to the large volumes of fertilizers and water that rice requires by promoting water and nutrient-use efficiency the concept plays a critical role in the reduction of these gases towards helping combat effects of climate change the rice sector is one of the largest or the the fastest growing agricultural sub sectors in in kenya and actually across the world because in terms of consumption in terms of cereals actually it's almost now overtaking ways here in kenya with an annual growth rate of about slightly over 12 percent per annum which is a way beyond the consumption growth rate for both the wheat maize and other cereals so you can imagine how serious this particular commodity is because even of the import import bill on on rise particularly here in kenya we are the largest importers of rise in east africa and therefore the importance of rise subsector cannot be cannot be again said and for that reason you can imagine there's a lot of there are a lot of efforts geared towards a rice production and sometimes we may risk doing rise intensification at the expense of the environment and of course you can imagine the kind of the amount of pressure rice production puts on on the environment and of course and its effect on climate because of the the greenhouse gases that are produced within the the rice production fields particularly methane and other greenhouse gases it is on this backdrop that kilima trust has ambassador's journey to support the two rice grain regions in kenya that is eastern and western regions for cross-learning opportunities to introduce regenerative agriculture through sustainable rice cultivation rotational cropping with leguminous crops and management of crop waste streams the project is funded by a care foundation and seeks to foster public and private partnerships along this value chain the ultimate goal is to promote the use of innovative technologies and generate evidence of developed and tested business models for scaling up as it also boosts farmers production capacities we came up with this particular project called reduce reuse recycle rice initiative furthered by the ikea foundation of the netherlands and it's geared towards ensuring that there is increased adoption of sustainable rice production practices and also adopt regenerative or what you call circular economy within the subsector according to research by eagerton university despite my irrigation scheme being more intensive in comparison to western kenya the yields per acre are considerably lower but why is this a situation what is very clearing is that is more advanced in the marketing market linkages and the orientation of farmers to innovations in the value chain and therefore they have well organized marketing system they have the farmers are highly linked to marketing processing there are several meals up to 15 i think as compared to aero a hero is not well established in terms of the western western kenya in terms of the value chain and innovations so but the difference is that the productivity in western kenya is higher so with the intensification in eastern kenya where farmers don't allow the the farm to rest continuous irrigated irrigated system does not allow the soil to breed so continuous eboxy conditions does not allow microorganisms to survive because there is no oxygen for nine months in a year so in western western west kenya the farmers produce at least once one crop plus an additional mini crop so the rest of the time is a rest period for the farm so nutrient content the soil organic matter the the overall production system is better in western kenya at the production stage overuse of fertilizer in the fields has been a challenge to address this millers like moirai's grow as multi-purpose cooperative society has adopted the urea displacement system where nitrogenous fertilizers like urea are applied in a more efficient way on the other hand input providers like margo enterprises in western kenya can already see great uptick of the pelleted urea by the farmers the nitrogen advertiser found in the market is in granule form and that granule forms all those granules are the ones which are applied by the farmer through broadcasting so we have realized the cost of applying and the amount of waters are being applied is too high now through the four hour program they have financed us to compact those granules into parrots thereby reducing the amount of waterizer being applied into the field of course also reducing the cost so when you go to apply into the chamber we don't broadcast what we shall do we are going to apply them deeper into the soil through that method of urea deep placement this fertilizer is slow release and most the demos that we have done is just a one-off application after 21 days we did 21 days and when we applied this and it's just enough for that farmer for the whole production process and with that in the directory that we have we have increased from a production to two to thirty percent and now the adoption is really coming up i can proudly say i've already sold up to around 800 bags of this and if you visit some of our farmers in gonialla you in west kennel and andajero will be able to find that now they understand the use of the pelleted urea as a way of increasing rice production in addition to improved fertilizer application the project is also intensifying adoption of crop rotation where farmers intercrop with leguminous crops like green grams which are excellent for nitrogen fixation when we are doing the cooperation the yield starts to grow up again we do green grams after green grams we do rice when we put rice when we put green grams we can even get more money like the one i did myself i did i get a lot of money from the green grams it supported me in school fees in hospital even in some other things it helped me a lot beyond the rice grain rice husks and straws are made by products in rice production the straws contain silica which takes much longer to decompose leaving farmers with limited options on how to utilize them they end up either being burnt or fed to livestock despite their low nutrition value to address this the r4i csa project in partnership with eagerton university has piloted vermicomposting where red worms are used to break down the straws into rich organic manure and vermi liquid which farmers can use on their farm or even sell the straw from rice has got a lot of silica there is a uptake of silica in the straw and therefore they cannot easily be biodegradable the worms plays a very important role they introduce hydrolytic enzymes into the straw so we mix together with the organic mat organic matter from cow dung and within a period of 60 days all this straw now has been biodegraded from through the mechanisms of hydrolytic enzymes and also the the red worms are very very active they feed also on this and within a short time if you leave them in the farm without doing family composting you will come back after 90 days and you still get it as hard as it is without breaking down so that is why you see most of the rice production systems one of the biggest problems is what to do with the straw rice husks on the other hand have been a menace to millers for a very long time they account for the bulk of waste at the point of milling in a period of one month we are able to mail exactly about eight thousand kilograms and out of eight thousand kilograms rice ass is about 800 kilograms we had a charge a particularly on the space for keeping this rice husk because a 250 metric tons is much much much husk and we used to ban that task initially but due to the preparation growth and the scarcity of space particularly in moya we don't have any space where we can take this husk and burn but tables are turning rice husks are now becoming a sought after input in production of diverse products from fabrication of stoves that use rice husks carbonation of husks for production of organic fertilizer to reach organic material for tree nurseries the opportunities are many we started working on this innovation because as you when you walk around you find a lot of waste that are just dumped outside and uh most of you are propelled by the amount of waste that was coming out of this small town and so we were seeing the dump site which has been a very big problem even to the government on how to dispose the waste so we realized that a lot of waste that were being disposed there are combustible waste and so we're thinking on a way on how we can turn this waste into um energy and that's why we came up with this kind of stuff that then could be used to burn that waste to to energy at the same time help in management of those waste this innovation is gradually taking shape with women adopting it as an alternative to using firewood over 10 youth who have learned how to add value to rice husks kilimotras has helped create linkages for them with more rice growers where they get the rice asks for carbonation to make biochar cream synthetic ready to use for farmers as mulching material but it doesn't end here kilimotrust has linked to awareo with safyorganix an organics fertilizer manufacturer which uses the shared husks for production of organic fertilizers initially actually we were doing the whole process here so we will do the carbonization here but now we realized that it is one of the bottlenecks and definitely was taking quite a lot of time and also limiting our capacity so what happened is we chose to look for people to work with and people we can train on how to convert their rice husk into biochar so and one of the things that happened interestingly then climate trust was also in the picture so we brought people like uh on board we have about six teams that are doing that for us and the good news is the these people are able to win a good income from the venture which i would otherwise they would otherwise have moved to urban centers to look for jobs so we are reducing that in directory we say at sophie organics we are employing about that youths locally with eastern kenya having intensified value addition companies like lake basin agritech are working towards knowledge transfer in the western region the cost of producing rice is too high and most of that cost is actually taken by a fertilizer so this is the reason why we decided to look for which are other cheaper ways of improving soil fertility in rice production and we also learned from our colleagues in in safe organics which was already in the field of biochar production so our intention was to replicate the same in western kenya because we had seen the impact that biochar had in rice fields anywhere already vincent and his team have introduced biochar to tree nursery owners given that the charred husks can be used solely on plants or into the high nitrate and moisture retention capabilities [Music] [Music] going forward as all these interventions take shape cross-learning opportunities will be critical to scaling up and transforming rice farming to become more sustainable given its important role in addressing food nutrition security and improved incomes for all the value chain actors to find out more about our for icsa project by kilimo trust visit their website www.kelimotrust.org [Music] you",
