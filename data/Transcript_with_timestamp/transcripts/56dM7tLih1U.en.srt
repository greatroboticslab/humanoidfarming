1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,799
i'm really happy that this morning we

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,560
can welcome for our keynote speak

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,880
speaker someone who really is

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,120
exemplifying the solidarity

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,120
um that jimmy has has so rightly

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,040
suggested we need

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,640
you mentioned that vex and vets medics

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,840
don't always work that well together and

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
we're now going to hear from a

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,480
veterinarian who is working in a medical

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,640
institution

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,000
and developing vaccines which are

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,720
appropriate for use across that divide

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,920
in both livestock and humans

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,320
professor professor george

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,960
is a veterinarian who is the a pi at the

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,239
chemri welcome trust unit here in in

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,559
khalifi

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,559
and is a assistant professor in the

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,200
center for tropical medicine and global

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,399
health at the university of oxford um he

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,399
has just been um awarded an incredible

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,960
prize by the royal society the royal

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,920
society africa prize for his work on

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,120
viral zoonoses and he's going to talk to

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,320
us today today about his experience as

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,080
um someone who crosses these boundaries

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,200
and the development

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,600
of a rift valley fever vaccine suitable

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,479
for use in humans and livestock

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,000
so with that i would like to pass across

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,439
um to professor george worriemway and

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,720
we're really looking forward to hearing

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,799
from you today so thank you so much

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,320
thank you liam and then i'd like to

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,240
first start by thanking all the

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,200
organizers for this uh fantastic

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,439
conference uh i mean one health has been

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,439
on the fringes for a very long time but

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,360
uh it's now sort of center stage and

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,600
this is our opportunity to really push

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,759
this

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,360
agenda that really makes sense in terms

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,920
of disease control so um really like you

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,320
know following jimmy smith's uh talk i

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,600
mean that's that's gonna be a tough act

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,399
but there are some things that he

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,479
mentioned about siloed thinking and uh

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,159
in all the sort of different facets that

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,759
uh we deal with in health and

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,680
you know my my

52
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,000
view of one health in this space of

53
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,239
vaccinology is looking at developing

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,480
vaccines for humans through the lens of

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,920
animal health and vice versa so if

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,480
you're developing vaccines for

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,319
veterinary you know for veterinary use

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,080
looking at the

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,560
the impact of those vaccines and the

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,920
development process from from a human

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,599
perspective so um i'm going to talk

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,360
about a program that i've been working

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,519
on for a while now so this started

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,400
sometime in

65
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:37,440
2012 which which tells you about the

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,640
sort of scale of time that you need to

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,319
develop

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,000
vaccines and and

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,000
also speaks to the sort of rapid

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,360
development of covet vaccines that we

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,519
have seen because that has been shrunk

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,280
down to about 100 days

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,920
so it's about developing a single

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,080
vaccine for using

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,200
humans and livestock against reef valley

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,440
fever

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,239
this audience i don't think i need to

78
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,159
talk about um

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,159
sorry myself okay i don't think i need

80
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,720
to talk about the the importance of

81
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,959
animals to uh to human health for this

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,560
particular audience in fact this this is

83
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,000
a photo taken

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,080
uh among a collection of lots of photos

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,080
on the ill reflector sites so i would

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,159
urge you all to look to look at that

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,800
it's got fantastic

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,280
visual representations of the importance

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,360
of animal health to humans

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,000
and i like this photo because it just

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,200
demonstrates the pure joy that animals

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,280
bring to to humans especially children

93
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,840
but of course we also know about the the

94
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,080
economic importance the you know there's

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,799
been lots of studies demonstrating the

96
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,319
uh impact of life you know animals to

97
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,080
livelihoods financial security i always

98
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,120
mentioned that i was

99
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,519
only able to go to university because my

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,080
grandparents who raised me on an animal

101
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,000
and they saw that animal and that

102
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,239
generated income you know some some

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,439
funding for me to go to university and

104
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,400
i'm sure there are many others in the

105
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,319
audience who have uh similar stories

106
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,319
one of the other things we share with uh

107
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,560
livestock are infectious diseases in

108
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,360
fact over sixty percent of

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,680
infectious diseases are in humans have

110
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,199
uh involved an animal uh sort of

111
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,720
transmission and uh for the emerging

112
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,040
infectious diseases that we're seeing

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,919
now that you know that are increasing in

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,000
incidence that percentage is much higher

115
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,800
so um when you're thinking about

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
controlling human disease it it just

117
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,600
illustrates the point that you also have

118
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,560
to think about animal health

119
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,440
just because of that uh connection

120
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
um

121
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,600
so i'm going to talk about reef valley

122
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,440
fever which is a virus that was

123
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,800
identified in kenya in the 1930s it is

124
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,880
an rna virus in the family fenu very day

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,759
there are no vaccines available for it

126
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,479
or no specific therapeutics which is why

127
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,080
it has been prioritized by the african

128
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,400
union and the world health organization

129
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,240
so um rvf

130
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,560
is is has a complex transmission cycle

131
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,360
by complexity meaning that you know for

132
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,080
me it involves quite a lot of

133
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,440
mammalian species and lots of

134
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,199
mosquito species so but the simplistic

135
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,840
sort of explanation is that you have

136
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,360
very heavy rainfall that causes floods

137
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,039
which increases uh the number of

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,080
mosquitoes

139
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,000
to transmit the virus

140
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,600
sorry um

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,880
able to to transmit the virus this

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,360
increase in mosquito numbers uh allows a

143
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,240
mechanism for the virus to circulate in

144
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,960
in animals some of the mosquitoes are

145
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,360
infected you know for life the eggs are

146
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,960
you know if they had had a blood meal uh

147
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,560
that has infectious virus the virus has

148
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,039
you know gone through its progeny

149
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,120
through the eggs uh and so the virus

150
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,759
transmits i mean the mosquitoes transmit

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,199
the virus uh in animal species most

152
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,680
commonly sheep goats cattle and camels

153
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,199
and during these epidemics where where

154
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,840
you have very high levels of viremia

155
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,919
viral load circulating in these animals

156
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,800
the viruses can then the mosquitoes can

157
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,960
then transmit the virus to humans

158
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,199
or also to wildlife now the virus um

159
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,520
sort of has been detected in wildlife by

160
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,039
way of seroprevalence studies but the

161
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,440
impact of rvf in livestock is really not

162
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,360
fully understood but in domestic

163
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,319
ruminants like you know the ones of men

164
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,319
should you you get

165
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,400
to about adult animals and of course in

166
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,800
young animals the mortality is much

167
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,199
higher this is over 90 percent and you

168
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,599
know the classic uh the classic sort of

169
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,240
hallmark of disease is uh abortion

170
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,319
storms so nearly all animals in a farm

171
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,720
that are pregnant would abort

172
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,280
in humans the disease um is described

173
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,680
more like um through like illness with

174
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,520
very non-specific symptoms but a

175
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,840
proportion of these individuals develop

176
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,120
severe disease with high case fatality

177
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,560
rates and and

178
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,000
there's been some

179
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,080
sort of uh

180
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,039
evidence uh although anecdotal

181
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,280
suggesting that the case fatality has

182
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,319
been you know of recent epidemics in

183
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,319
humans has been rather high so

184
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,120
ranging from about 30 percent at least

185
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,639
for from the east african uh

186
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,800
outbreaks

187
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,840
so where is rvf common is predominantly

188
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,680
in africa and um these maps you know are

189
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,080
like you would have seen much like this

190
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,919
for all sorts of things basically the

191
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,800
darker it is the

192
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,080
the more uh cases there are or have been

193
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,759
reported

194
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,840
on the left you've got humans on the

195
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,919
right you have livestock the most

196
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,560
important thing here to note is that

197
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:58,319
there is a lot more um

198
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,759
cases of rvf reported in livestock than

199
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,160
in humans which

200
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,720
possibly just illustrates the

201
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,440
the poor sort of surveillance systems in

202
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,199
in humans in some of these settings

203
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,639
the other thing you will notice you'll

204
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,120
note is that kenya and south africa

205
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,240
or east africa and southern africa tend

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,479
to be really severely affected by rvf

207
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,160
outbreaks just based on the number over

208
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,039
the previous years

209
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,400
so what can we do to control rvf

210
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,840
we have licensed

211
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,160
inactivated

212
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,759
vac and live vaccines for they're using

213
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,719
in livestock

214
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,880
these have some safety drawbacks and

215
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,039
some need multiple doses to

216
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,719
generate an effective immune response

217
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,399
you need high containment for their

218
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,560
production because it's an actual sort

219
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,279
of rvf virus that you're dealing with

220
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,640
whether inactivating it or modified in

221
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,720
some way

222
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,959
and it's not they're not diva compatible

223
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,440
so you cannot differentiate

224
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,360
vaccinated animals from um

225
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,080
non-vaccinated animals because the

226
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,560
antibody response to the whole virus is

227
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,920
similar to that that's caused by natural

228
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,240
infection

229
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,040
so there are no licensed vaccines for

230
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,200
human use and so the the

231
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,560
the thrust of this program has really

232
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,519
been about developing a vaccine for

233
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,600
for human use but also developing safer

234
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,279
uh vaccines that can be used in

235
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,600
livestock this is a very old um

236
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,320
table from the 1930s just that all i

237
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,480
want to demonstrate here is that

238
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,600
a humoral immune response so an antibody

239
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,519
response is sufficient for protection uh

240
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,920
because of time i i wouldn't really go

241
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:43,320
into the table but but you the point i

242
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,320
want to sort of make is that if you pass

243
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,760
into animals again you can confirm

244
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,480
protection uh suggesting that antibodies

245
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,480
are important we also have from very

246
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,560
many studies that have been done or over

247
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,360
the years demonstrating that

248
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,680
neutralizing antibodies uh correlate

249
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,200
with protection and so if you're

250
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,040
thinking about a target for a vaccine uh

251
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,040
you know construct you want to develop

252
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,600
antibodies you know develop a vaccine

253
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,839
that can elicit neutralizing antibodies

254
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,560
and we finally we know that if you

255
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,640
recover from rvf infection then these

256
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,279
neutralizing antibodies tend to be long

257
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,640
lived and this is just a case

258
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,160
demonstrating that

259
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,880
an individual hard neutralizing

260
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,800
antibodies up to 25 years later without

261
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,880
exposure in the intervening period which

262
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,680
is uh really remarkable

263
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,920
so we know what the the target of this

264
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,320
neutralizing antibodies are it's the

265
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,160
surface of the viral glycoprotein of the

266
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,360
of the virus and these are viral

267
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,519
glycoproteins known as gn and gc

268
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,040
uh the the analogous

269
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,200
sort of situation here is the spike

270
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,040
protein for coronavirus so it's like

271
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
targeting the same sort of surface of

272
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,800
the virus it's an enveloped rna

273
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,240
virus so we set out to use the chadox

274
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,279
one platform

275
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,720
because

276
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,320
at that time the chadox one vaccine

277
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,800
platform which is basically just a

278
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,959
vehicle to deliver the vaccine had been

279
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,360
used in humans and

280
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,839
had been shown to be safe in humans this

281
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,160
is very important as a sort of starting

282
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,519
point for a human vaccine because you've

283
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,800
already

284
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,040
saved so much costs by having uh already

285
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,880
a track record in in the safety profile

286
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,440
you will i will talk about the costs of

287
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,160
developing vaccines later but the chad

288
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,320
oxford platform was safe in humans

289
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,320
previously when used for other vaccines

290
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,640
and all we did basically is get the

291
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,360
targets the the genes that encode the

292
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,120
virus uh rvf gn and gc and uh

293
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,399
you know inserted this into the chadox

294
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,320
one vector which when in when you

295
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,360
vaccinate an individual gets into the

296
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,240
cell uh expresses the the proteins and

297
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,079
these uh rvf glycoproteins then uh

298
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,600
stimulate an immune response and

299
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,000
hopefully you've got a very high immune

300
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,920
response to confirm protection

301
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,320
so the methods of manufacture were

302
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,680
already well established so it really

303
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,360
was a a matter of plug and play

304
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,279
so this image just illustrates the um

305
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,000
the the sort of uh pipeline for

306
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,160
development is it's simplistic uh but

307
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,959
it's just illustrates the point we've

308
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,040
had the pre-clinical uh discovery period

309
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,440
where we identified the rvf i mean

310
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,079
inserted the rvfg and ngc into the chad

311
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,720
ox1 platform uh the plan was to do

312
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,120
pre-clinical studies in mice uh and then

313
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,760
go on to livestock trials and human

314
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,440
studies and and if you know hopefully if

315
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
it all works well then you'd have a

316
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,920
single vaccine

317
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,519
for using multiple species

318
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,639
so

319
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,959
the first

320
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,920
really encouraging data we found was

321
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,519
that if you immunize mice and expose

322
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:08,959
them to rvf virus two months later

323
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,480
you had 100 protection and um

324
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,279
you know this was very exciting whereas

325
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,680
the group that uh were given a placebo

326
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,240
uh did not uh you know were not

327
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,440
protected and succumbed to infection

328
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,760
so the next sets of studies in livestock

329
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,720
were studies that we did um in very

330
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,680
close partnership uh with hillary uh

331
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,560
with vishnani and others and the idea

332
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,959
here was to immunize animals and

333
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,360
following um follow them up for a month

334
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,920
for immune response to to develop and

335
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,079
then expose them to rvf virus so this is

336
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,199
a typical approach of evaluating

337
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,920
vaccines

338
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,639
so the long and short of it was that a

339
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,959
single immunization in all those species

340
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,120
provided a hundred percent protection so

341
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,040
none of the animals that received chadox

342
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,760
were shadows one

343
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,160
um developed disease and in fact as

344
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,320
illustrated on this on this plot the

345
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,560
with the blue representing chadox one

346
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,199
group and the black representing the

347
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,040
licensed product and the uh gray

348
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,199
representing placebo

349
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,800
all the chadoxon vaccinated animals

350
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,279
mounted on neutralizing antibody

351
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,920
response uh for the rift wax which is

352
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,959
available in kenya as a you know rvf

353
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,120
vaccine

354
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,199
uh two of the animals one in you know

355
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,880
cattle and and goats did not mount a

356
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,600
neutralizing response and were not

357
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,279
protected further supporting this idea

358
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,120
that um

359
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,680
neutralizing antibodies are the main

360
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,760
sort of thing you need to elicit to

361
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,839
mount an immune response so the

362
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,760
publication is up there if anybody wants

363
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,560
to to follow that

364
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,800
so

365
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,360
the next step was to look at rvf in

366
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,320
pregnancy again using a similar

367
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,639
uh

368
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,880
experimental design where you vaccinate

369
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,680
uh for this we vaccinated early in

370
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,920
gestation and challenge them later with

371
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,320
a with a with a virulent virus and then

372
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,720
monitoring the safety of the fetus and

373
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,000
also our protection

374
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,639
so these studies were done in the

375
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,800
netherlands with uh

376
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,000
jerome kotakaz and others

377
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,399
and the top

378
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,440
panels represent the

379
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:17,120
results of the vaccine development in in

380
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,839
sheep um and the bottom are the goats so

381
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,800
that both i mean in both species the the

382
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,720
antibody response was really very high

383
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,480
it was within the range we observed in

384
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,639
the kenyan study

385
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,240
artillery

386
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,639
and and uh the the chadox one vaccinated

387
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,160
group in red here were

388
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,480
um what protected against uh viremia so

389
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,160
you see the viral load there it just

390
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,600
means that the animals were protected

391
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,320
against um

392
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,800
you know rvf infection there was no

393
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,600
illness in the pregnant uh

394
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,880
animals um and no sign of infection in

395
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,360
the fetuses in in sheep in the goats

396
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,160
again we've got very high levels of uh

397
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,120
protection although two of the 25

398
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,040
fetuses uh succumb to infection

399
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,040
suggesting that there might be

400
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,759
differences in the

401
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,959
either the mechanism of protection or

402
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,399
other factor in in goats in terms of uh

403
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,480
the level of protection that you see

404
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,880
following vaccination but the primary

405
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,680
aim of this uh experiment really was to

406
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,160
demonstrate that the chadox1 vaccine was

407
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,399
safe which is something that current uh

408
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,480
you know most of the vaccines currently

409
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,639
uh are unable to

410
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,399
you know show you know that we we really

411
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,480
don't have any vaccines that can be used

412
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,560
in pregnancy other than uh the

413
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,600
inactivated versions that need uh

414
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,959
multiple immunizations so this was a

415
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,959
really um good point to sort of uh get

416
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,160
that you know proceed from

417
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,600
uh

418
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,959
yeah so

419
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,600
the next step was to look at the

420
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,160
now that we've demonstrated the um

421
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,320
the safety of the product in uh in

422
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,079
pregnant and non-pregnant animals

423
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,199
ensured you know very high levels of

424
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,319
protection

425
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,439
we the next step was to conduct a field

426
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,400
trial

427
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,199
looking at the um

428
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,120
whether the vaccine elicits uh a similar

429
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,280
you know performs as well as the

430
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,919
licensed product in a study that is

431
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,600
powered to evaluate data sort of

432
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,520
population level

433
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,839
so the previous studies were designed to

434
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,000
look at efficacy uh you know for the

435
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,839
first study and then the second one was

436
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,240
to look at safety and pregnancy whereas

437
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,160
this is now looking at a field level and

438
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,559
these are studies that we did in uh

439
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,039
kapiti where we um

440
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,280
looked at

441
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:41,280
180 animals per species so this is with

442
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,679
the as as indicated there that was a

443
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,559
study protocol and this study was done

444
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,799
to

445
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,480
very high levels very high standards so

446
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,480
uh to gcp

447
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,360
and i believe it's probably the largest

448
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,280
uh sort of gcp veterinary trial that's

449
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,200
been done globally

450
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,200
i haven't had anybody object to that in

451
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,480
the different places i've talked about

452
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,799
this um so as i say the study was done

453
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,799
in kenya it's in healthy non-pregnant

454
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,960
animals and the animals were followed up

455
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,200
for a year and the end point of the

456
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,440
trial the thing that we will use to say

457
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,760
whether the vaccine performs as well as

458
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,320
a licensed product is a neutralizing

459
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,799
antibody titers now i don't have the

460
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,120
results for this but um analysis is

461
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,360
underway uh but should be available

462
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,840
sometime early next year but the whole

463
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,160
point is that this data will be used to

464
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,080
support the registration of the product

465
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,559
for use in east africa

466
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,039
and other and other countries uh in

467
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,360
africa where there is very high uh sort

468
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,440
of exposure to rvf

469
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,160
so i'll switch gears a bit so now we're

470
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,559
moving to humans so the veterinary

471
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,640
development is of course very advanced

472
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,120
uh and we are now you know the point

473
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,520
where we're thinking about registration

474
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,799
but how about the human studies so

475
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,919
we've begun a phase one study in humans

476
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,080
in oxford and this is uh the typical

477
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,480
uh approach is to start with a low dose

478
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,400
go to a medium dose and a high dose for

479
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,880
any of you who've been following uh you

480
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,559
know the oxford astrazeneca kobe 19

481
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,720
vaccine development you will have seen

482
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,200
some of this sort of experimental

483
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,000
designs uh or trial designs very early

484
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,280
on

485
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,200
so this this sort of phase one study is

486
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,799
is done in a small number of

487
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,640
participants with the aim of just

488
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,799
looking at the safety profile of the

489
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,640
product and of course whether it also

490
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,160
elicits an immune response the desired

491
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,880
immune response

492
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,760
so we already have for the platform in

493
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,640
general so chadox1 in general we already

494
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,799
have of a safety database over a billion

495
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,440
doses of course because of the oxford

496
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:46,080
astrozone coveted vaccine but now we

497
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,080
want to add data specific to the rvf

498
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,400
vaccine and so far the vaccine is

499
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,039
performing well both in terms of the

500
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,360
safety uh and the immune response and

501
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,600
again we expect this data to be ready

502
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,080
you know for sort of dissemination uh

503
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,799
sometime early next year

504
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,280
so i've i've taken that fairly quickly

505
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,760
just because of time but but the summary

506
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,280
of this work is that uh you know we've

507
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,840
identified very high levels of

508
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,960
protection in livestock now the vaccine

509
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,760
is highly

510
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,760
efficacious and safe in pregnant uh

511
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,039
ruminants and the safety and

512
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,200
immunogenicity is expected to be as good

513
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,440
as current licensed vaccine which is the

514
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
sort of the smith band vaccine supplied

515
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,280
by

516
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,679
kevin vappy analysis is ongoing as is

517
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,960
the analysis of the human phase one

518
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,360
study

519
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,480
that is going to be available as from

520
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,520
next year

521
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,440
so in terms of so for the veterinary uh

522
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,559
development the veterinary use of the

523
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,080
product

524
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,880
um that has a clear sort of pathway um

525
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,880
that we would follow for the um are

526
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,520
stipulated by uh the local regulators um

527
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,840
and you know nba the the veterinary

528
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,600
medicines directorate and and so

529
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,840
and there is actually a harmonized

530
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,240
process for for doing this in eastern

531
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,440
africa but how about the the human

532
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,520
landscape

533
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,080
now one of the most difficult things to

534
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,559
do as as you know the audience might

535
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,440
appreciate is to predict when the next

536
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,320
um reef valley fever outbreak would be

537
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,640
if you if if you are to predict that

538
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,640
with very high sort of confidence you

539
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,159
would be able to design

540
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,159
a vaccine efficacy study so um but in

541
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,400
the absence of that it becomes really

542
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,799
difficult to predict uh you know to

543
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,600
design a vaccine efficacy study for you

544
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,880
for

545
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,840
rvf so an alternative approach would be

546
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,480
to

547
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,960
use correlates or protection as done for

548
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,480
the vaccines so we know

549
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,720
you know the threshold the antibody

550
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,720
threshold you require to provide

551
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,520
protection against rabies for instance

552
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,240
and even yellow fever for instance um

553
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,080
another another route is to think about

554
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,720
an animal rule which is something that's

555
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,440
done by the fda in the u.s

556
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,520
but

557
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,600
because this is a problem rvf is a

558
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,080
problem that's predominantly restricted

559
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,080
to africa and the arabian peninsula i

560
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,310
think we think that there is a need to

561
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,440
engage the regulatory

562
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,679
[Music]

563
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,559
national regulatory authorities in the

564
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,480
continent about the the best sort of

565
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,559
strategy towards licensure of this

566
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,559
vaccine whether it's emergency use

567
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,200
authorization as we have deemed as we

568
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,480
have seen for uh covert 19

569
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,559
and then followed by sort of a a phase 3

570
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,360
study where you're looking at

571
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,840
efficacy evaluation if ever there was a

572
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,640
massive sort of epidemic you also need

573
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,200
to think about what vaccination regimen

574
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,240
is going to be eventually used and so

575
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,000
this relies on doing

576
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,760
further studies phase two studies where

577
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,039
you look at

578
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,039
a single dose versus two doses and and

579
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,799
which of those performs well and think

580
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,960
about the deployment and how would you

581
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,679
deploy this vaccine would you deploy it

582
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,080
in humans only or would you deploy it in

583
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,000
humans and animals during an epidemic

584
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,080
and you know this sort of thing calls

585
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,360
for uh you know massive stakeholder

586
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,760
engagement

587
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,480
including the bodies listed there so

588
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,760
very much a one health focused sort of

589
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,240
uh

590
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,159
strategy also not just the in the making

591
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,640
of the vaccine and the planning of the

592
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,760
experiment but also in the future work

593
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,440
on the deployment or of the product so i

594
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,830
think i will stop there

595
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,880
um

596
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,840
[Music]

597
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,280
sorry

598
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,840
yeah i'll stop there and just

599
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,840
acknowledge that this is work that has

600
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,240
involved um

601
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,600
very many partners and uh at the center

602
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,440
of this has been the international

603
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,400
lifestyle research institute very close

604
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,799
partners there uh as i mentioned earlier

605
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,520
but also i can just or not i cannot

606
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,279
overstate the importance of engagement

607
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,520
with the

608
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,960
regulatory and policy stakeholders

609
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,640
including the national biosafety

610
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,720
authority and the ministry of

611
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,240
agriculture livestock and fisheries

612
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,279
because this would not have been

613
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,039
possible without their support um and

614
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,200
you know and and guidance through the

615
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,360
through the process uh at hillary you

616
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,760
know campus and kapiti so i think i'll

617
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,919
stop there and uh hand it over back to

618
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,039
you leanne or

619
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,360
for any

620
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,679
kind uh

621
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,799
questions thank you so much george for

622
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,640
that great

623
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,880
great talk um and uh there's lots of

624
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,640
questions in the chat um but i'm going

625
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,559
to just jump in

626
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,720
with one that's maybe a little bit less

627
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,200
technical we talked a bit at the

628
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,440
beginning about the the difficulty of

629
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,000
breaking down silos so i'm going to ask

630
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,840
you a personal question um

631
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,200
as as a a veterinarian i'm now working

632
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,600
at chemry how how have you felt how have

633
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,000
you found that transition sort of moving

634
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,559
from the veterinary field into um sort

635
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,760
of medical research how and have you got

636
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,400
any um suggestions for those of us here

637
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,559
or online about talking across

638
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,279
disciplines and making those forging

639
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,880
those connections thank you

640
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,320
yeah that's a good question i mean i

641
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,080
think um

642
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,679
the first thing to say is is that i

643
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,559
never left veterinary medicine my

644
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,880
background is i'm a vet as you said and

645
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,720
i think the the

646
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,279
i have sort of

647
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,039
enthused colleagues at camry and and

648
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,480
others you know that i collaborate with

649
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:28,640
uh globally about the value of

650
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,520
animal health not just from the

651
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,559
perspective of you know at the public

652
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,320
you know deployment because when you

653
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,559
think of one health

654
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,360
there's a there's a big

655
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,360
sort of bias i think towards thinking of

656
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,279
control programs like a country you're

657
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,880
deploying a control programs or

658
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,960
brucellosis and you have to think about

659
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,600
both but i think i've been using people

660
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,240
to think about more even at the basic

661
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,240
level that their difference in

662
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,520
differences in uh

663
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,679
animals and humans in terms of the uh

664
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,440
immune sort of the way they mount an

665
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,320
immune response the components of the

666
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,039
immune response so you can understand

667
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,400
pathogens and and how you know to how to

668
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,880
control pathogens uh by looking at how

669
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,960
the host paris you know house parasite

670
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,360
or host virus interaction differs in the

671
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,640
different species so it's been more

672
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,720
about

673
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,600
showing a different way of thinking

674
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,520
about the particular problem that you

675
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,240
know colleagues are working on

676
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,279
and applying this sort of one health um

677
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,919
basically exploiting synergies in in uh

678
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,480
in sort of immunology in both humans and

679
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,200
livestock it's not necessarily easy but

680
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,440
it to me it just makes sense

681
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,679
yeah no that that's wonderful and very

682
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,039
sort of reminiscent of that original one

683
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,880
medicine um concept and and also very

684
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,400
great to hear that you never feel that

685
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,799
you've left veterinary medicine i'm

686
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,880
sorry if that was what came across i

687
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,200
always have uh have this myself where

688
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,520
people said oh you're in research maybe

689
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,760
you're not a vet anymore but we're still

690
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,000
we're still veterinarians at heart

691
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,039
um so i'm just gonna pick up on a couple

692
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,840
of questions that came in the chat um

693
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,320
so

694
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,080
there was one question that uh suggested

695
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,720
that given the um the prolonged drought

696
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,799
followed by um very heavy rains that

697
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,120
we've experienced in the country you

698
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,440
know does this make you feel that an

699
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,960
outbreak might be more likely and if so

700
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,840
is there anything people should be

701
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,000
considering to protect themselves

702
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,000
or protect prepare

703
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,720
yeah i mean i think

704
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,080
that's again is a good question um there

705
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,480
are others in the audience you know

706
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,559
bernadette and others who can make a

707
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,440
really informed decision based on the

708
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,159
sort of

709
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,360
mathematical modeling and predictions

710
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,440
i think i will i would emphasize more

711
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,120
uh rather than moving rather than

712
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,720
thinking about you know is there an

713
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,840
outbreak that's going to happen because

714
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,840
of these

715
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,720
conditions i think i would emphasize

716
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,640
being

717
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,840
ready all the time which is uh something

718
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,080
that

719
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,480
jimmy mentioned in his sort of

720
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,760
introduction to the introduction that we

721
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,919
need to be ready we need to have

722
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,240
surveillance systems that are

723
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,039
ready to sort of uh

724
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,640
go

725
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,399
uh without necessarily um

726
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,200
sort of having to wait for a set of

727
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,720
circumstances to come to come into

728
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,039
sort of existence so

729
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,200
you you can always if we have

730
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,559
surveillance systems that are

731
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,000
full you know

732
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,000
that are not just focused on a

733
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,640
particular disease not just focused on

734
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,679
rvf then you will be able to respond

735
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,559
quickly

736
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,320
um

737
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,159
irregardless of whether there's a

738
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,840
drought or whether

739
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,520
there is not i think i would emphasize

740
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,640
more on having um

741
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,440
that of

742
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,360
you know everyday sort of readiness to

743
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,600
address sort of uh outbreaks i don't

744
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,480
know whether i'm making sense there

745
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,919
rather than focusing more just on an rvf

746
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,919
outbreak

747
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,080
yeah absolutely i think that that's

748
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,039
really clear that we really need to put

749
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,640
um

750
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:06,159
our efforts into preparedness and

751
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,159
surveillance um
