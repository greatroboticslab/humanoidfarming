3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,620
my little elves Chalmers tractor and my

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:25,840
bifold wheeler rake and

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,700
after I cut the Hey ladies in the field

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,740
flat like what you see down here and

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,250
down there's a little bit of fun raked

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,980
area a

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,070
rake out the field

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:44,140
take these rows that were cut and then

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:48,460
rate flips the rows over so that the the

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:51,700
underside of the grass is now exposed to

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:56,200
the Sun so that that dries and it also

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:58,030
merges it up into a room that's small

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,200
enough with the hay baler and pick it up

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:06,729
this is what we call window a great for

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:09,850
to help the underside of the roll dry so

18
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:12,399
you just flip it over and also merged it

19
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:15,399
together so that come in here later this

20
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:18,970
afternoon with a hay baler it'll pick it

21
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:21,460
up in daily you know what I'm doing here

22
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,510
is that now I rake when there's what I'm

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:27,340
gonna do on the ground so that

24
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,799
right here the leaves of the old fella

25
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,840
and the grasses don't all fall off they

26
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:35,320
get too dry and brittle and as you move

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,659
them lose all that leaf and you can lose

28
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,229
your own easily 2030 percent of the

29
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:45,100
biomass that you're trying to get into a

30
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:47,290
veil so right now then I have to wait

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,880
for a couple hours for it to dry I'm

32
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,580

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,310

fathers guys number one thing on drying

38
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:09,610

00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,610
humidity so it won't pass today

40
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:16,430
