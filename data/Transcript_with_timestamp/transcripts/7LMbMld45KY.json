  "text": "guys how we doing welcome to good works tractors i'm asked all the time why do i need a snow plow snow pusher or anything else i've already got a bucket on the front of my tractor what's wrong with just using that and yeah it's going to remove snow it's going to push it it's already there it's convenient it's paid for move that snow where you want to be done with it simple as that every attachment is built for certain tasks set a pallet forks a grapple a tiller a brush hog and just because it's on the front of your tractor right now doesn't mean that it's suited or intended to move snow there's a lot of reasons why a bucket is not good for snow removal let's get into that now if you like what you see here would you do me a big favor give me a thumbs up on this video and if you'd like to see future videos like this one hit that subscribe button right down below if you're in the market for tractor accessories or attachments maybe even a tractor itself read through the description below or go to good works tractors you'll find all sorts of cool products for tractor owners like us now don't get me wrong i love tractor seat time just as much as anybody else however it can be frustrating and annoying especially if it's freezing cold out and you're in an open station tractor to not get the job done quickly so with that being said you take a look at the design the construction of a bucket from the front of your tractor could be a skid steer too the point being it's designed with a bottom back sides to trap and hold material whether that's dirt it could be mulch it could be rock it could be snow but the point is is that it's gonna keep it inside there and not let it go without an effort from the operator so with a snow pusher or a snow plow you're driving forward pushing that snow wherever you want to and when you got it to that point where you want to leave it there all you do is just start backing up maybe raise the loader up a little bit and away you go the same can't be said with a bucket with a bucket again that snow wants to stay in here or whatever material it is so you have to lift that bucket up you have to rock it forward you have to shake it out there's still going to be a lot of snow trapped in these corners here that's overall going to make it a very inefficient tool just from that aspect so if you take a look at the snow pusher right here and it could be a plow as well it's the same concept you'll notice there's no bottom there's no floor there's nothing to trap and hold material in it that's the big difference between a bucket and a pusher so when you're moving that pile of snow forward you just simply back up and it's going to stay there one push is no big deal but push after push after push and then every time you go out and plow and then season after season that's a ton of additional time that you're spending just on shaking a bucket to empty the material out one of the ways that i've seen i've read online to kind of help snow release and maybe not get stuck in these corners is going to be using some sort of a spray you know a lubricant silicone teflon pam even but just sprayed all inside here i've kind of seen mixed results i'm pretty sure i even saw a thread on one of the tractor forms where a guy did a test with and without the teflon or silicone spray inside of the snow blower didn't really see much of a difference in the result but overall i think it didn't do any harm so maybe it'll help you maybe it won't but it's something to look at if you're going to use your bucket another consideration with the design of a bucket here is going to be this bottom edge that comes along here not only is that going to trap and hold material that's in here and not allow it to release but it also means it's intended to dig dig down dig into a pile whatever material it is again gravel dirt mulch it could be any of the above but the point being is that as this is riding along that plowing surface it's going to want to naturally just dig into whatever that surface is if you have gravel stone even asphalt or a concrete surface you catch any edges on there or loose stone it's gonna maybe chip an edge collect that stone put it into your yard somewhere you don't want it so you can see a bucket right here with a long edge designed to dig compare it against a plow right here it's going to have skid shoes tucked underneath the bottom or if you have a snow pusher you'll have skid runners on either end that are going to prevent this main leading edge here from digging down into the ground the intent is to just kind of glide along with those skid shoes or the skid runners not dig down but just follow that surface there the contour of it take care of the snow and move that where you want to so that's something very important to consider because that could end up costing you a lot of additional money repairing that damaged surface down the road if you're concerned about costly repairs to the surface you're plowing whether it's a gravel drive concrete asphalt the same thing can be said for your bucket as well because this edge right here is going to wear significantly and unevenly meaning you're not going to be able to use it very well for other digging purposes that it's really intended for this edge right here is going to end up rounding off at the corners here you'll see a lot of significant wear chewing up the main portion of this wear edge and then it'll come back in and die off into these side plates right here and once you get to that point you're really making it unusable however if you really want to use your bucket or maybe it's just a temporary solution until you can figure out a better long-term solution there's some things you can do to prevent that uneven and unnecessary wear on your bucket edge [Music] you're going to see a couple of different products right here one is going to be essentially a type of skid shoe that you can put onto your bucket just kind of fit it on there like that and it's going to keep it from allowing the main bucket edge here to make contact with that plowing surface both protecting your plowing surface and the bucket itself the trade-off is going to be the fact that your bucket is then going to be oh maybe three quarters or an inch above the plowing surface therefore leaving a significant amount of snow behind another option you can look into is something like this poly or uhmw is called a cutting edge that you can put onto your bucket kind of mount it down underneath here and make this the sacrificial edge instead not only is poly a good option for that but this is very protective of paved surfaces as well anything like your asphalt or your concrete a good way to sum up uhmw is that it's going to cut like steel but protect like rubber now some buckets are going to come pre-drilled which this bucket here was already pre-drilled you can see there's actually an additional steel edge on the bottom a lot of smaller compact and sub-compact tractors will not have a pre-drilled bucket edge on here so you may have to do a little bit of drilling on your own in order to secure the uhmw now i will have links below in the description of the video if you want to get more information on where to buy skid shoes like this or the uhmw while we're talking about edges on buckets you know what i totally forgot i even had this it's winter time you don't think about it too much but this is a really cool option for the summertime it's going to be a way to enhance the versatility and the digging capability of your bucket instead of having this smooth edge here you'll have these teeth this whole bar here just tightens down you have these allen set screws here that just tighten down it stays in place i honestly never take mine off because it's that handy to have when i need it but something to take a look at this is a heavy hitch tooth bar you go to their website and order directly there anything on their website you get five percent off with code gwt so again i'm not saying that a bucket is not going to work for snow removal it certainly will it's just that there are certain tools that are meant to be used for snow removal there are certain tools that are used to be able to scoop and dig and hold material so they're two different things and trying to use one for a different purpose it's gonna be kind of frustrating and could end up being very costly for you even if you're trying to save some money up front it could cost you more down the road so if you found this video helpful consider giving me a thumbs up and also if you haven't done so subscribe to my channel by clicking that button below and as always read through that description you'll get helpful information links on where you can buy those products like those skid shoes or the poly edge or maybe a snow pusher or a replacement bucket or a whole tractor we can put together a whole package for you and ship it to you as well well until next time stay safe we'll see you soon right inside let's go come on have fun start over you",
