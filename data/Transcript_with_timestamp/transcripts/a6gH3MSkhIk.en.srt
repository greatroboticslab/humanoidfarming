1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,679
all right so we're here at the property

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,639
just pulled up we picked some apples out

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,120
on the road when we first come in to

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,480
give the deer a little bit more

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,960
of a treat in the back uh today

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,439
we're going to be working on adding a

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,000
manual timer to the solar

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,039
panel or the solar power box for the

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,720
fountain

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,800
and then hopefully get the fountain to

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,359
turn on and figure out how to do this

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,840
timer

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,440
it's kind of confusing let's get to it

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,640
i'm going to hop in the truck and get a

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,200
few things

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,840
and we'll head over to the solar power

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
box

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,360
and i will show you guys what's going on

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,920
all right i just want to explain what's

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,280
going on here this is our

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,399
solar box that is our panel that we

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,039
still have not built a frame for

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,960
uh since this is just experimental this

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,079
box is just a cheap box from

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,120
the parts store or the hardware store

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,159
in here we have a deep cycle 12 volt

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,760
battery

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,360
connected to a solar

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:15,600
charger a regulator

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,880
that runs to the solar panel and then

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,200
runs to the battery

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,320
so that is constantly connected it's

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,200
probably hard to see

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,680
but we finally have high voltage then we

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
have

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,400
a 500 watt power inverter

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,479
and this box was built to take this

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,240
extension cord right here

39
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,479
and run the pond we hooked it up

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,000
and everything worked however the

41
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,960
battery died so i just want to go

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,840
over how we had it hooked up before and

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,200
why it died

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,040
and then what we're going to do to fix

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,840
that

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,680
this here is a manual timer basically

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
you plug it into your wall

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,759
you set the time then you take these

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,560
little pins

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,880
and you push them down to the time that

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,920
you want the power to be on

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,680
and this thing just goes and keeps track

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,080
of time and then whenever the time gets

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,200
to these little pins

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,080
the power will kick on and

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,760
so i had this hooked up to the inverter

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,160
and then i had that pump

58
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,840
hooked up to this now the only thing

59
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,640
that sucked about this setup

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,760
was constantly 100 percent

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,360
of the time the inverter had to be on

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,640
now this inverter pulled more power

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,720
than the charger could keep up with

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,840
overnight which would kill the battery

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,200
so it would be charging

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,640
during the day and running so

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,920
the just keeping this on 100 of the time

68
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,720
was not an option so the next thing i

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,959
looked up

70
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:59,200
was maybe coming up with an arduino

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:02,400
or a twino board or something that

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,840
went in between the battery and the

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,239
power inverter and would kick off and on

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,200
and it would use let's say a six bolt

75
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,800
reference

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,440
well that was okay but then i ran into

77
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
this what we're going to do is hook this

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,879
up

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:23,440
to the battery the 12 volt lead here

80
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,599
and then we're going this is the switch

81
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,239
side so the switch side is basically

82
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,239
going to

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,080
we're going to splice the power run it

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,599
in and run it back

85
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:40,879
out so it says it can take up to a 250

86
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:45,120
volt 16 amp

87
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:47,280
so i'm a little skeptic because these

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,480
connectors here are just the quarter

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,959
inch connectors

90
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,000
and uh we're going to be running the

91
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,599
power inverter and

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,239
ultimately our homemade pond fountain

93
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,680
which was made out of a

94
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,720
fifth horsepower sump pump

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:15,840
so that's that let's uh go ahead and get

96
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:15,840
started on this

97
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:37,040
[Music]

98
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,840
all right i want to give you guys a

99
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,960
rundown on the solar power box for the

100
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,199
fountain the

101
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,040
first version of this box was pretty

102
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,759
straightforward we had

103
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,800
a 12 volt deep cycle battery an inverter

104
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,360
and 100 watt solar panel

105
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,960
solar panel obviously ran to the solar

106
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,919
uh charge controller

107
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,680
then tapped into the battery and the

108
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,919
idea was to

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,120
use the inverter with a manual timer

110
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,639
that we could then plug our diy

111
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,720
sump pump into for the fountain

112
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,240
however what we ran into with this

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,320
manual timer

114
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,680
is the inverter needed to stay on

115
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,680
uh 100 of the time even when

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,199
i didn't need the power but the inverter

117
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,320
needed to stay on to operate

118
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,680
this uh what ended up happening was

119
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,720
literally the first day

120
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,800
the battery was drained just from

121
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,039
the power that the inverter used just to

122
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,440
even be on not even pulling

123
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,919
power for the pump so

124
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,440
what i opted to do this time was to go

125
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,880
to a digital

126
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,280
timer and this timer

127
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,199
allows for 20 settings and it's a 12

128
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,240
volt dc

129
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,479
um timer that runs off

130
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,080
of a 12 volt reference which happened to

131
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,600
be these two wires

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,400
and basically uh

133
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
these two wires on the right hand side

134
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,360
are

135
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,000
the power the positive lead to

136
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,000
the inverter

137
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,680
the way this works is you set the timer

138
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,840
on this to to turn on and whatever time

139
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,280
you tell it to turn on and turn off

140
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,080
then what it'll do it will

141
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,960
basically supply power to the power side

142
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,560
of the inverter

143
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,319
and the inverter will turn on so the

144
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,360
entire system will turn on

145
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,840
based off of this system this system has

146
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,440
a self battery or it can sustain itself

147
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,639
for i believe three weeks

148
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,639
without a 12 volt reference but the

149
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,919
battery charges off of this

150
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,039
and doesn't use much power at all

151
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,960
what that did was alleviated the

152
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,720
constant draw on the inverter and

153
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,400
literally the inverter all i do is i

154
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,199
leave the power on

155
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,919
on the inverter and the timer will just

156
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,280
kick off and on when i want it to

157
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,400
so at 3 30 this thing is supposed to

158
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,199
shut off

159
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,840
and we're gonna see if the pond fountain

160
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,120
shuts off

161
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,479
get out my other phone here

162
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:31,280
the diy solar power box

163
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:34,080
with the timer

164
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,080
five seconds

165
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:43,759
[Laughter]

166
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,520
oh look at that we have success

167
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,879
that did exactly what it was supposed to

168
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,759
do how awesome

169
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,879
is that we have it set now to run about

170
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,639
30 minutes

171
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,360
every hour and it gives enough time for

172
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,160
everything to charge up right now i

173
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,879
believe it's

174
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,120
set to to run at five we're going to

175
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,680
work on the scheduling to make sure that

176
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,120
we're working with optimal sun

177
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,720
and the best times to

178
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,400
aerate the pond with the fountain

179
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,199
ideally i would love to have the

180
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,160
fountain on

181
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,599
all the time however when it comes to

182
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,599
solar

183
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,120
we just can't do that with that setup

184
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,720
that i have i was actually looking at a

185
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,240
bubbler setup so

186
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,919
anyways if you like this video go ahead

187
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
and give it a thumbs up leave a comment

188
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,800
down below on maybe some suggestions on

189
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,000
how to make

190
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,000
