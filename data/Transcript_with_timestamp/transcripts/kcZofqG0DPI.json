  "text": "good morning modern standards this morning's video is going to be all about starting our tomatoes and growing our tomato plants in soil blocks in the house we've been getting a ton of specific questions about our growing system and how we're doing it so I'm excited I am encouraged to share how many people are growing their own or getting ready to start their own inside that's very encouraging and exciting we'll be eating BLTs with a lot of modern stutters the summer so let's dive in and let's talk a little bit more about our Tomatoes and how we're growing them there's been a lot of people making comments about our lights being too low they weren't lower but I was leaving them low to let the little guys catch up a few of them here and here yesterday I raised the lights up believe it or not 2 to 3 inches and there was room between the light and the plants and they have grown immensely what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna raise our lights up to links Believe It or Not yesterday and the plants are already touching the lights again mister Figueroa you're making too much noise with the chickens over here it's hard for us to hear the grow light that we're using here on these tomato plants is a regular fluorescent shop light setup with t12 grow light bulbs and over here we have our LED strip lights I have not been sitting my plants right away what I do is I let them grow up a little bit and when I find one plant that's better than the other like this ones growing nice and straight and the base on this one doesn't look as nice so we're gonna get rid of that one over here it's kind of a 50/50 it's not a lot healthier but it is I think by pulling this one out now that one's going to grow a lot faster but I hate thinning I'm too soon just in case one of the other doesn't make it the grow light setup that we have is not the most expensive setup it's just the most affordable setup that I can find I know that stronger lights out there but I don't want to focus our plants on growing up inside the grow lights are just to give them a good start and that way we can have a good healthy plant started inside so I'm not gonna you can go out and you can spend hundreds of hundreds of dollars on good high-quality lights if you want these are not them these are strong enough lights to do the job that we need them to do let's talk transplanting these seed start we're not gonna be putting these seed stocks directly into our garden from these soil blocks you can do either one or two things last year we bought these bigger pots on Amazon see if I can find the link farm if I can I'll put them in our store on Amazon then we put the soil blocks in here and added more soil and they had all this area to grow and our plants wish I had pictures of them this year I need to get better with taking pictures of things and saving the pictures I'm gonna say our plants were is good 12 to 24 inches tall when I use thick stalk the pots works good when we took him out of the pots they were brute bombs they could have believe it or not used to have gone to a bigger pot so this year what we're gonna do this winter I made this large soil block maker you want to watch that video see how to make when you sell I'll put a link for that video right here but what we're gonna do is we're gonna transplant our medium soil blocks into a larger soil that we're gonna be making but a lot of people been asking how do you know when your plants are ready to go into the next size container a soil block so the way I determine if my plants are ready to go to the next soil block what's these ones are believe it or not see all these little root fibers that's all the roots growing out of your soil block so this is telling me all right the plant has used up the space inside of this soil block and it's time to go to the next one the other really cool thing about the soil blocks and seeing the roots like this is now our plant is ready to go to another soil block or go to the garden and get directly planted and whatever we're planting it in and these roots are going to just keep growing where if they're in a pot like this the roots get stuck when they hit the wall of the container they turn back around and they get roof on they call if you look it's almost like a ball they get balled up and they'll grow into a circle so the roots don't grow out easier and when you that's what you have sometimes you have the transplant shock is the plants are in new soil but they don't know hey my roots can grow they're still bound up where the soil block let ends come to the end and they grow out and sometimes they'll grow into the other soil block sometimes they'll just grow into the tray but that's good so when we go to transplant them they're gonna have to be ready to take that new soil on the new nutrients from the new soil and they just grow amazingly I'm gonna need to transplant our tomato plants I'm not gonna do it in today's video sometime this coming week we're gonna be transplanting these and finally being able to use the large soil block maker so I'm excited for that so keep your eye out for that video rather to show you one other trick to encourage your roots to grow down let's go over here and I'll show you now this is one of the reasons we use the plastic trays without holes as we can flood the tray I know you normally when I'm watering you see me what sprayer somewhere spraying the top of them that's when they're small and when they're just starting to turn into plants once they get bigger if we flood the tray Colton's flooded and I mean flood the tray that water in a matter of minutes is gonna be Swick up by our soil blocks you can see it's basically just in the grooves when I flooded it there's about a half inch of water in there same with this one what that does is it makes the soil blocks wick the water up from the bottom so the pot that's gonna have the most water is the bottom and that encourages the plants roots to grow deeper you want that for a few reasons you want to have good deep roots and if you're just missing the plant the water staying up high mostly something's gonna seep down low but the majority of the water and the wetness is gonna be up high so it's not going to encourage those roots to grow them deep it's gonna encourage surface roots which is it a good thing especially if you garden with a deep mulch back to eating garden you want to encourage deep root growth and there's few reasons for that one is it makes a stronger plant the second is it makes the roots grow down deeper it encourages a better growing plant but less watering and you don't want to water your plants the more you water your plants the more the roots are gonna stay up high you might be watering your plants May but might be looking good and healthy but you're not encouraging the roots to grow deep and the deeper the roots go the more nutrients those plants are gonna have because they go in deep down to the soil going down to the resources and pulling up what your soil has down there for and then sucking it up putting it into the fruit whatever the pot is that you're gonna eat and then in return giving us more nutrients so if you do deep bedding back to eating garden or just mulch your garden you're gonna get that and you're not gonna need to water your garden what's just amazing so if you have a drought you don't have to worry about it you might look at the dirt and go oh it's dry but deep down it's damp there's moisture down there and your plants are gonna grow so like starting our plants this way and teaching the roots to grow down and encouraging that from the beginning it gives you a better plant and a better garden and more nutrient-dense food it's just amazing I'm gonna talk more upcoming videos of how we're gonna plant them but I'm gonna touch on it real quick so I know there's a lot of people that are in a growing zone that they can be planning their garden sooner than we are so two more things I want to touch on before we end the video one is you want to plant calcium in with your Tomatoes when you plant them in the garden so if you have a good source of quality eggshells you can start saving up your eggshells and baking them in the oven to dry them out then you can put some eggshells in each hole where you plant them in your garden and they'll have a good source of calcium while they're growing you could also do oysters shells that's another good one so just be thinking about that how am I gonna get calcium to my tomato plants if you have tomato and rot or blight most of the time that's due from an insufficient source of calcium so if you can start the whole off with calcium the plant should have the calcium while they're growing and then you'll have less battles you're fighting throughout the growing season the other thing you bring you in close hopefully I can get the camera to focus but you have these little knobs on your tomato plants when you plant your tomato plant you should plant them so you bury the first Leafs or right up to the first leaves all those little nubs will grow roots and by planting your tomato plants deeper in the ground they're gonna have more roots the plants gonna get stockier and harder so the winds blowing it's not gonna blow the tomato plant over I'm just gonna make for a stronger plant right from beginning I hope the chicks haven't been too noisy boy yeah in the video right over there fingers crossed we'll be getting those outside this coming week exciting times here in the homestead come springtime hope you enjoyed today's video I didn't answer all of your questions leave them in the comments down below and we'll see you right back here tomorrow at lawmakers a guy the modern homesteading self-sufficiency and freedom [Music]",
