00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:11,120
information hi i'm saskya a healthy soil

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,519
is good for the productivity and

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,039
qualitative crops we're here in Swift

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,949
abount we're just the preparations are

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,480
being taken to sow agreement or one of

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:26,310
the ways to make and keep a soil healthy

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,039
soil health is the ability of the soil

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,230
to cope with incoming diseases and pests

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,140
and keep their population levels

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,030
sufficiently low so that crops do not

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,270
suffer damage a healthy soil ecosystem

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,440
contains a rich soil biodiversity

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,700
sufficient amounts of soil organic

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,660
matter microorganisms nematodes

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:53,730
anthropods and earthworms key

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:57,870
microorganisms are bacteria fungi and

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,180
protozoa they are especially abundant in

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,809
the area next to the plant roots where

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,700
they interact in numerous ways soil

21
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,580
organic matter is the basis for

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,920
productive soils it allows for more

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,500
activity and diversity of life in the

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,140
soil which in turn stimulates soil

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,909
processes that contribute to healthy

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,820
crops soil microbes stimulated by

27
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,640
organic matter can suppress pathogenic

28
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,369
microorganisms liberate mineral

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,640
nutrients and improve the soil aggregate

30
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:35,549
stability the best practice to increase

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,920
soil organic matter is by adding already

32
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,700
stabilized organic matter such as

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,369
compost to the soil many agricultural

34
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,770
practices can help the soil ecosystem to

35
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,829
function optimal and to build up soil

36
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,259
health the more practices are combined

37
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,500
the greater is the potential effect on

38
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,049
soil health preventative practices such

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,420
as cover crops promote beneficial soil

40
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,479
life which in turn contributes to

41
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,570
healthy crops here we see a good example

42
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,149
of a combination of two best practices

43
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,980
cover crops and anaerobic soil

44
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:15,890
disinfestation asd

45
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,230
crops such as italian ryegrass can be

46
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,409
incorporated into the soil for example

47
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:24,590
to build up soil organic matter and to

48
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:28,129
improve the soil structure when combined

49
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,709
with anaerobic soil disinfestation the

50
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:34,549
soil environment is temporarily turned

51
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:36,950
anaerobic certain microorganisms are

52
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:40,160
stimulated to grow and under anaerobic

53
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:42,530
conditions they produce substances that

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,190
are suppressive or toxic for several

55
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,590
soil-borne pests and diseases in this

56
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,560
way cover crops cycle nutrients and

57
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:54,319
build up soil organic matter while the

58
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,010
soil gets disinfected through the asd

59
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,220
practice solarization is a similar

60
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,200
technique in solarization the soil is

61
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,660
covered with a plastic film to trap

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,670
solar radiation heating the soil to a

63
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:12,049
temperature that kills diseases and

64
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,640
pests in bio solarization the speed of

65
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:16,280
the process is increased by the

66
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:20,030
incorporation of organic amendments or

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,760
composts by understanding the soil

68
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,489
ecosystem and how practices above and

69
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,680
below ground effect them we can benefit

70
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:30,069
from their functions to increase soil

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,069
health
