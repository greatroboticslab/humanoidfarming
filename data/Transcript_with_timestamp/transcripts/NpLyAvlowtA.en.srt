00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,639
welcome to

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,320
fers Welcome to My Channel today we are

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,440
harvesting orra follow along and see the

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,640
way we did

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:21,680
it as you we observe we will realize

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,599
that the okra is planted amidst other

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,840
crops it is a mix cropping that we have

9
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,640
as you can observe it here see the okra

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,440
you see some um

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,120
a very young uh corn likewise you see

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,200
Caba in form of a mixed cropping so it's

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:45,079
not only okra that is there as you can

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,280
see yes so it's mixed cropping see the

15
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,840
bigger okra

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:55,359
here and then some uh Little Corn they

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,920
also there so it is mixed croing so

18
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,800
right now we want to do some harvesting

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,000
of the okra for follow along and watch

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,720
to the end and see what we can also

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,720
achieve apart from eating the okra

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,720
fruits

23
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,680
so

24
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,159
coming as you can see we were using

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,479
knife to cut the orra fruits not just

26
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:28,040
cutting them by mere hands what

27
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,040
is see to the

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,280
end check

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,280
ERS check ERS see any other

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,600
one right

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,159
now there are no more okay let's check

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,399
other

33
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,399
plants no

34
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,079
more okay we have

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,840
here all right

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,000
now if you don't Harvest them on time

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,720
they become too hard and not suitable

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,120
for eating any longer they must be fresh

39
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:17,840
and soft for them to be suitable for

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:21,760
eating otherwise you leave them like

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,640
that to mature and dried

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,760
up you may leave them to mature and dry

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,319
up such as this ones it become too hard

44
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,400
like this one now you may leave them on

45
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,120
the plant and let it dry up for

46
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,640
preservation of seeds for

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,640
planting in another planting season okay

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,400
when it dries up and the seeds be ready

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,640
for planting in another planting

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,200
season but for consumption they have to

51
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,000
be soft and not hard so for you to be

52
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,159
