nutrition and incomes also improve

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,319
and farms become more resilient to

76
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,799
extreme climate events

agroecological principles are very

85
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,680
important because if we maintain the

86
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,320
diversity of crops on a piece of land

87
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,600
the diversity of microbes and beneficial

88
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,759
insects also increases

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,880
hence no need of putting fertilizers and

90
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,040
manures and

91
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,919
other pesticides and chemicals and all

92
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,560
from outside

93
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,360
so we can recycle the nutrients that is

94
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,160
from the field

95
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,000
to animals or livestock and from the

96
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,360
livestock we can give directly to this

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,199
field so we are here

98
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,880
to explain about agroecological

99
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,919

100
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,400
uh the recycling procedure and

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,520
the economic economic principles like

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,360
year round income

103
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,759

104
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,560
people no caste no religious basis and

105
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,560
