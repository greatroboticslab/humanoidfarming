1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,960
hi I'm here at mosy and the sunflowers

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,759
are growing and maturing and we've got

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,280
one uh that hasn't actually uh

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,040
completely matured but it's enough that

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,400
we can show you the counting that we

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,199
want you to do when your sunflowers are

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,880
ready um don't do this when they're

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,119
still looking like this and they still

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,439
got the yellow petals and in particular

10
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:23,519
you can't see the SE pattern very

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,080
clearly in the middle you want to wait

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,039
until all these little flet things have

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,679
fallen off and you can see the black

14
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,399
seeds usually black seeds it might be

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,960
white L of the sunflower underneath

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,600
right so once you got to that stage um

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,800
uh for extra bonus points before you get

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,039
to that stage you can count the petals

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,440
but that's not the key thing we need

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,520
once you before you do anything else

21
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,399
just measure the height to the middle of

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:54,640
the head and I've got

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:56,640
98 CM plus 3 so that's 1 m 2 uh for this

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,000
sunflower now I've measured the head I'm

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,030
going to uh take it off I've taken one

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,439
off I don't know how easy it's going to

27
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,040
[Music]

28
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,439
be not very easy if the answer scissors

29
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,439
is what is what's recommended at this

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,119
[Music]

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,200
stage okay that's not going to work we

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,660
need

33
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,840
to

34
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,840
[Music]

35
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:27,320
um there we go okay so um as I said I

36
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,200
think this seed head actually probably

37
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,079
died and the the flower heads fell off

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,119
before it got maturity the other thing

39
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,479
that we'd like you to do you can't do it

40
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,280
on this one cuz they've got moldies

41
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,520
measure these green brats count the

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,320
green brats around the back but the key

43
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,000
thing is to look at the spiral counts so

44
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,200
let's see if we can do that on this

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,159
sunflower just I'm just brushing off the

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,320
flower heads so I can see the seeds

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,200
underneath and now we can see I think we

48
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,880
can see just about there's a pattern of

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,399
seeds here and there's a little spiral

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,520
of these four seeds all in a line what

51
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,719
I'm going to do is just so I can count

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,719
where I'm up to one

53
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,200
two

54
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,720
three four so I've taken out that spir

55
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,080
now the key thing that we're trying to

56
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,239
count we're not trying to just go around

57
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,360
the outside and go one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

58
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,680
say how many there are outside cuz

59
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,519
that's not very accurate what we want to

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,280
do is count how many of these spirals

61
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,000
there are so I'll start at this one and

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm actually going to call that zero for

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:36,720
reason you see in a minute so this is

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:40,680
one 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 I'll just pull

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:46,159
that one out so I can check later

66
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:48,560
on that's that's 0 10 1 2

67
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:53,120
3 hard to see cuz it's not very mature

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,879
one four five 6 7 8 9 and I think that's

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,760
a 10 there I've got a Rimer on the

70
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,560
camera who'll tell me if she thinks I've

71
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,560
missed any I think that's 10

72
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,840
okay once we once youve taken this

73
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
another way of a much better way of

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,920
doing this actually is to take a photo

75
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,799
of the seed head and then use your um

76
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,680
computer you can do it in uh in

77
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,599
PowerPoint to draw lines onto your photo

78
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,920
that way if you get it wrong you can try

79
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:29,730
again that's another one so where do we

80
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:32,840
start from 0 10 20 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

81
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,840
[Music]

82
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,159
okay and I can see already that we're

83
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,439
going to get in quotes the wrong answer

84
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:50,720
right so I started here at zero that's

85
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:53,120
10 20 30 31 32 oh no that is right 33

86
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,760
34 right so what we've done is we

87
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,920
counted all the way around the outside

88
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,000
of the um head the number of spirals who

89
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,319
started at at zero went up in 10 it's

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,239
got to 30 and then finished off with 31

91
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,159
32 33 34 before we had number one so

92
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,280
this has got 34 spirals around the

93
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,799
outside of its sample head which um if

94
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,920
you like Fibonacci numbers is good news

95
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,519
cuz 34 is a Fibonacci number now the

96
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,680
next thing we want you to do is to

97
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,359
notice which way that spiral is this as

98
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,960
you go out from the center outwards it's

99
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,000
curving around in a clockwise Direction

100
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,639
so we'll call that a clockwise spiral

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,720
and then the next thing is to uh look at

102
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,440
the spirals in the opposite direction

103
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,160
dire so we might need to zoom in again

104
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,800
right so we were counting spirals there

105
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,479
before but if you just follow my finger

106
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:45,520
there's another line of spirals here so

107
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,520
I'll pull out a seed to count that one

108
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,840
one two again maybe a good tool would

109
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,520
help here there now these are flatter so

110
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,120
there should be um less of these I guess

111
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,759
around the seed head so let's see if we

112
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,039
can count those by hand 0 1

113
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,520
2 this is what if you do end up taking a

114
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:13,360
photo you need to be really careful cuz

115
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,560
you see these areas around here where

116
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,840
the structure isn't very easy to see and

117
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,800
maybe if you rub off some of the extra

118
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,880
Gunk it's easier to see the little white

119
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,840
dots that really help your eyes see the

120
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:32,199
spirals so that's one two 3

121
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:34,600
4 five 6 7 eight nine and I think that

122
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,600
one is

123
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:49,560
10 oops extra one there by

124
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,240
mistake uh okay so that was uh from our

125
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:57,960
beginning 0 10

126
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:03,840
11 12 13 14 15 16

127
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:06,599
17 18 19 20 21 do you know I've done

128
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,759
this probably 20 times now on sunflowers

129
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,560
and I'm always just amazed every time it

130
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,280
comes out with Fibonacci numbers it is

131
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,680
just fantastic so uh the good news is

132
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,960
that the uh science museum is capable of

133
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,680
growing sunflowers which obey the

134
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,319
Fibonacci rules the big question is out

135
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,199
of all of these sunflowers how many of

136
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,840
the time how much of the time are we

137
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,199
going to find that that's true when it

138
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,440
isn't true what are the patterns going

139
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,440
to look like um so good luck with the

140
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,440
counting
