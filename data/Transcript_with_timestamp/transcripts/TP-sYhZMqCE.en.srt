[Music]

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,160
going on a road trip going to get a big

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,080
one what are we going to go

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:26,480
get bow a

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,519
bowl are you excited yeah good I too

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,519
pretty

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,040
excited in January Ryan

10
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:37,800
was in a car accident and he injured his

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,280
ribs pretty bad and could not work we

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,120
went a couple of weeks without a

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,480
paycheck and we went over a month

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,399
without going grocery shopping and one

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,879
of the good things that came out of it

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,039
is we realized that we had enough meat

17
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:55,960
and

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,440
vegetables in our storage because we had

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,440
raised enough from our farm and we were

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,199
okay there the only thing that I had to

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,080
have Ryan stop and get at the grocery

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,880
store during that month was milk butter

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:16,080
cheese and sour cream all dairy products

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:19,200
and all I could think was we have got to

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,520
make getting these cow's bread the top

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,960
priority so after 2 years of trying to

27
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:29,600
find a bowl locally to breed our Piney

28
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,840
Woods and now our mini Jersey we have

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,399
fin finally found what we hope is the

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,280
perfect bow he is very young so we have

31
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,439
a little bit of time to raise him before

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,720
he's going to be ready for the job but

33
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,799
it should be pretty minimal amount of

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,840
time considering we've already waited 2

35
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,560
years so one of the challenges that we

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,799
have faced with having our own cows is

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,439
finding the proper B to breed them with

38
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,479
originally we thought we were going to

39
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,600
have access to a Pineywoods bowl that

40
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:07,000
didn't work work out and we started

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,239
searching for a bowl for our piny Woods

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,800
2 years ago well a lot of people don't

43
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,360
realize is Piney Woods are actually a

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:19,000
very short breed of cow they're usually

45
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,519
under 45 in into the mini range and so

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,120
what I was looking for was a mini bowl

47
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:30,480
or a bowl 45 in or shorter like a Dexter

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,760
um mini Highland mini jersey and because

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,120
we have a small farm with small kids we

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,519
really didn't want the bulll as a

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,840
full-time Adventure we wanted to borrow

52
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,280
a bull breed our cows and be done with

53
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,760
it that did not work

54
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,879
out at one point we had a texture lined

55
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,480
up but he ended up getting sold before

56
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,560
we had a chance to use him so the

57
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,519
journey continued on searching for the

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,560
right Bowl one that was small enough to

59
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,680
breed our cows safely but also you know

60
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,200
make Mak sure that they were disease

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,000
test disease free tested good you know

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,400
quality all of that became a very

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,319
difficult Journey we looked into Ai and

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,599
from everything in our research AI would

65
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:22,480
be a very expensive way to maybe get our

66
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,120
cows sprad looking into AI turned out to

67
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,760
be something that I didn't think we

68
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,200
could financially handle there were a

69
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,439
lot of different reasons why I also was

70
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,640
faced with AI technicians that said that

71
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:36,159
they could not get the straws for the

72
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,280
smaller bowls and nobody guarantees it

73
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,080
it's not a guarantee even if I pay

74
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,200
almost $1,000 to have my cow

75
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,080
AI I have no guarantee that it would

76
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,799
work and they don't come back and do it

77
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:56,239
again for free so it didn't feel like

78
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,120
the right fit for us in our situation we

79
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,799
don't have a cattle shoot we don't have

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,840
the infrastructure that would have made

81
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:07,959
made it easy to do AI so we went back to

82
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,159
looking at Bulls again we basically sat

83
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,920
back prayed on it said you know all

84
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,599
right let's see what the universe is

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,120
going to bring us we we know that the

86
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,160
right decision is ahead of us we know

87
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,680
that we're going to get our cows bread

88
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,400
we just don't know how yet and then I

89
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,720
came across an ad for some beautiful

90
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,720
miniature Jersey gold

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720

103
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Bubba

104
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:35,120
yeah oh you know what time it

105
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,160
is yes you

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,360
do just about the cutest time ever on

107
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,000
the

108
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:47,400
homestead so this is

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,960
trap he is our new Mini Jersey bull calf

110
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,840
and he will be breeding in a few

111
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,960
months when he's

112
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,240
ready to our mini Jersey Daisy and our

113
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,840
Piney Woods

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:08,000
so we are very excited to have this

115
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:11,080
opportunity for milk on our Homestead at

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,400
a much higher volume than goats or sheep

117
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,280
could ever

118
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,080
provide he keeps running for the door

119
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,680
even though it's closed it's like he

120
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,800
almost knows it's not locked I'm trying

121
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,000
not to get attached or overly

122
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,039
affectionate with him because he is a

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,440
bull and Bulls can be dangerous when

124
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,560
they're older

125
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,800
which is super hard cuz he is so so

126
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,360
sweet he wants more milk I'm trying to

127
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:45,280
break his bottles up into two feedings

128
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,360
for my sanity cuz his bottle only holds

129
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,880
half a

130
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,440
gallon so yeah he thinks he's supposed

131
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,680
to have more milk right

132
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,720
now but we're going to break it up into

133
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,520
two feedings a day instead of

134
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,479
one oh no put it his head don't pit his

135
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,400
head I have to keep telling myself that

136
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,039
my cows love to have their head

137
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,960
scratched so I'm trying not to do that

138
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,639
cuz he's a bull and I don't want to

139
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,440
encourage any off

140
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,199
behaviors but he likes his neck

141
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,680
scratched and he likes his body

142
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,680
scratched so I'll do

143
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,039
that it's hard not to love on him all

144
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,800
day long but I also want to make sure

145
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,120
that

146
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:29,800
he doesn't get to be a mean Jersey so

147
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,520
he's staying in the trailer today we got

148
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:37,560
home late last night and it was dark so

149
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,599
we said okay you just go to bed we'll

150
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,520
we'll set you up with a cool little spot

151
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:44,680
in the

152
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,280
morning so when Ryan gets home in a

153
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,520
little bit we're going to do just that

154
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,840
aren't we but buddy I keep calling him

155
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,440
buddy cuz he's like a buddy but

156
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,520
his his other friend that we didn't

157
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,000
purchase was named buddy so I'm like I'm

158
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,199
hope I'm not confusing him but yeah he's

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
doing good I shouldn't be letting him

160
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,240
look on me probably huh that's what some

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,159
of you probably going to be saying in

162
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:14,039
the comments I'm going to take all

163
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:17,120
advice that um is kindly

164
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:20,199
delivered and I'm going to do even more

165
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,599
research because I was actually thinking

166
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,680
we were going to end up getting buddy

167
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,960
who is already off of the bottle he was

168
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,720
a month older and then when I met them

169
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,800
it was obvious see how he just did that

170
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,680
headbutt thing that's

171
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,200
a I want my mama milk movement I don't

172
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,640
want them to think I'm mama so I got to

173
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,800
be a little more assertive with him

174
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,760
using my knee to push him back when he's

175
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,240
a little too pushy and I don't want to

176
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,320
stop him from licking me I oh my gosh

177
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,200
how am I supposed to not let him do that

178
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,080
oh I can't let him do that it's bad I

179
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,200
can't do this oh my goodness I'm going

180
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,079
to get so much Flack for

181
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,839
this God she's so

00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:06,720
sweet how do you people with bowls on a

183
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,160
bottle handle

184
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,680
this I don't know how to handle it but

185
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,399

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:58,320
locally that is small enough for her so

199
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,519

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,120

208
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:28,320

your knuckles on the

246
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:37,320
fence he is very excited to have his

247
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,839
bottle you know there is one thing that

248
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,639
I can say is that cows are a much

249
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:47,040
different investment than

250
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:49,360
goats you are going to spend four times

251
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,000
as much on a single

252
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,959
animal the inputs of milk are going to

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,079
be four times as much the inputs of time

254
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,240
are four times as much everything is

255
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,920
just quadruples

256
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,320
but it's so going to be worth it I just

257
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,560
know it I can't wait till I'm just

258
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:12,480
making cheese and butter and enjoying

259
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,399
all of the fresh raw milk for our family

260
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,600
one thing I know is that with three

261
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,680
growing boys the goat milk was just not

262
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,680
high enough volume and high enough cream

263
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,279
to make all of the other sub products so

264
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,760
this was the best decision our family

265
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:31,160
could make and I do not regret it not

266
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,639
one bit I don't regret the time or the

267
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:37,079
money invested into this it is already

268
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:42,560
filled my heart with pride and love and

269
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:45,399
I am so glad oh that we could do this hi

270
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,399

271
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,600

276
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,480
dream really began to come true never

277
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,480
thought I would be able to get a mini

278
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Jersey

279
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:17,160
[Laughter]

280
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:21,800
heer but with the generosity of somebody

281
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,199
gifting this one to us made it

282
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,199
possible never could have done it

283
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:27,199
otherwise
