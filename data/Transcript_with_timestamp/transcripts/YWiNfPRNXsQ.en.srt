1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,160
do you need to buy a used tractor hey

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,320
I'm Mark Hall with Alabama Cooperative

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,280
Extension system a lot of people are

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,040
just getting started maybe getting

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,279
started as an organic farmer or you've

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,880
got land that you need to keep bush hog

7
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:19,720
and you're paying somebody to Bush Hog

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,279
and you wonder would it be cheaper to

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,880
buy a tractor in a bush hog we're going

10
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:27,439
to talk with Wayne Green who's a farmer

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,560
in Lauderdale County and uh he's bought

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,560
and sold equipment over the years and

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,399
he's going to tell us about buying a

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,480
lowcost tractor we're not talking about

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:39,399
a gently used tractor we're talking

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,520
about a tractor uh a low dollar tractor

17
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,280
at a get started tractor just a maybe a

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,280
limited use tractor why you tell us

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,760
about buying a tractor what do you need

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,559
to think about what do you need to look

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,920
for and buying a used tractor you know I

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,480
have Farmers that has five acres and

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,600
some has 10 and some of them has 100

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,280
acres what size tractor they need what

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,119
horsepower what's the most economical

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:10,600
forum and uh so I try to help them with

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:13,280
that uh this is a uh 30004 tractor which

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,840
I'd recommend for somebody had 5 or 10

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,960
acres uh maybe you know to do a little

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,920
tillage work or maybe uh bushhoging or

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,920
stuff like that with it's a it's a real

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,200
nice

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,200
tractor what I usually look at when I

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,920
buy a tractor I usually want to check

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,320
the engine oil in it and see if the

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,280
engine oil is good and clean in it and

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,799
then I I try to check the tires and make

38
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,040
sure the tires are very expensive now

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,479
and see if the tires are good on it then

40
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,000
I try to check the uh the steering on it

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,040
make sure the steering is tied on it

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,159
check your hydraulic lift I tried to see

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,280
if it'll raise up and how fast it'll

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,119
come up and uh check the PTO which is

45
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,280
the pair takeoff that turns a bush hog

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,240
if you're going to do any bush hogging

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,479
with it what what is clean oil in a

48
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,240
tractor this is the oil in this tractor

49
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,200
if you notice here in the sun see how

50
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,200
bright this oil is how pretty and bright

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,720
it is put it on your finger it's got a

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,959
pretty bright color so that tells me the

53
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,160
oil in this engine you know is real

54
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,360
clean yeah and you you can also tell by

55
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,599
oil if you see a lot of flakes in it a

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,040
lot of real shiny stuff like glitter

57
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,640
yeah that means you've got an engine

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,040
problem yeah if it's real black and dark

59
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,239
the tractor has not been taken care of

60
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,840
you know and you can always hold it out

61
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,640
in the sun you know and and that all

62
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,400
that light will show you what condition

63
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,360
you're oil is in uh would there be

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,159
anything else in the oil that you'd look

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,159
for water or is is anything like that in

66
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,239
issue usually if it's got water in your

67
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,440
oil it's going to have a creamy milky

68
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,040
type color so I would you know I would

69
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,879
look for that too if it's got a creamy

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,040
milky color it's got water in it okay if

71
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,519
you see something green on the ground

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,879
it's it's leaking

73
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,599
antifreeze um and that can be very

74
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:12,280
expensive if you got a radiator problem

75
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:14,879
uh and you know your engine uh if you

76
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,560
got most time if you say oil dripping

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,400
you got a problem most older tractors 20

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,480
to 25 years old you going to have some

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,560
oil seepage I mean you going to see a

80
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,519
few light spots of oil as long as this

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,000
just not dripping at a steady Pace you

82
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,200
know it's not going to hurt anything

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,519
and come up here and tell us a little

84
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,680
bit about tires and what you look for on

85
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,959
tires yes the tires on this tractor

86
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,120
they're they're worn down they're

87
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,599
probably about 30% and they've got a few

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,599
dry cracks in them and things but on a

89
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,400
small tractor like this it's not a lot

90
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,360
of weight so most of the time this tire

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,799
would probably last four or five years

92
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,920
anyway so I wouldn't on the small

93
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,920
tractor tires is probably not as

94
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,879
important as they are on a bigger

95
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,159
tractor with a lot of weight to them

96
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,159
when is it too much play in your

97
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:08,879
steering well when you you can always

98
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,959
turn your steering wheel and before your

99
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,480
Wheels start moving I mean you look at

100
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,840
your two front wheels and before they

101
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,840
start moving see how much if you turn

102
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,799
your steering wheel like 3 to 4 Ines

103
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,919
before your wheels move you know you got

104
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,000
a lot of wear in your front end so

105
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,040
that's going to have to be fixed it uh

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,039
this tractor somebody has added the

107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,360
power steering to it and I would

108
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:34,360
recommend if if you're buying a used

109
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,919
tractor uh power steering is real good

110
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,600
on one I mean you can make it without it

111
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:41,759
but it makes it a lot easier you know to

112
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,960
maneuver around with power

113
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,039
steering four-wheel

114
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,440
drive versus two wheel drive is that is

115
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:53,000
that an issue it I you know I would

116
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,960
recommend you know for most 5 to 10 acre

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,080
Farmers I would recommend just a two

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,039
wheel drive unless you got a front end

119
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,720
loader on it then the four-wheel drive

120
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,440
is does a lot better with the front end

121
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,759
loader uh the

122
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,639
Hydraulics with all tractors even a 35

123
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,919
horsepower tractor now would have

124
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,800
hydraulics the majority of tractors do

125
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,960
have hydraulics now um you hardly ever

126
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,520
see a tractor now with hydraul without

127
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,039
hydraulic system on it how how do you

128
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,160
check what would a firsttime buyer how

129
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,000
would they check to see if your

130
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,479
Hydraulics are good would you look for a

131
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
leak or the lift or talk to me a little

132
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:35,120
bit yes I mean you can always let your

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,800
tractor set and um set when your

134
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,840
tractors running and see if it's any oil

135
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,800
leaking out from under hydraulic oil and

136
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,240
also your lift when you um pull your

137
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,360
lever up or your lift to go up I mean

138
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,440
the lift should go up pretty fast if it

139
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,759
goes up real slow more than likely you

140
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,759
got

141
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,199
problems this is a lift system on this

142
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,800
Traer

143
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,880
um which you would use on a

144
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,400
bushog uh see how fast this lifp goes up

145
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,919
on this tractor it only takes like 10 to

146
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,599
15 seconds that tells me the Hydraulics

147
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,520
are in real good condition on this

148
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:20,840
tractor if you pull this lever and it

149
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,160
takes like a minute for it to go up you

150
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:27,000
got hydraulic problems which can be very

151
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,039
expensive okay uh talk to me about the

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,080
PTO yes checking your PTO on the tractor

153
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:38,199
you need to to when you put your lever

154
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,759
in into PTO you need to make sure the

155
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,520
PTO starts turning immediately if it

156
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,840
don't you probably got a problem or if

157
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,400
the PTO will not shut off when you put

158
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,720
the lever in the opposition you've got a

159
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,120
problem so either one of those you know

160
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,560
tells you you got a problem with your

161
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,000
PTO if it comes on real fast and it

162
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,400
stops good you know you're good this is

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,639
a 540 shaft the 540 shaft has six

164
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:11,520
splines around it like this it'll be six

165
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:14,080
of them your 1,000 RPM shaft has 21

166
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,199
splines so uh that's the way you can

167
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,479
tell the difference between the 540 and

168
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:23,919
a th000 RPM shave is the splines on the

169
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:26,520
shave one has six the other one has

170
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:30,800
21 if you're biner tractor and you have

171
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:33,800
a cutter with a 540 shaft

172
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,960
PTO shaft in your bush hog or bush hog

173
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,199
cutter and you buy a tractor with a

174
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,000
th000 RPM shaft that cutter will not

175
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,599
work on this tractor you will uh you

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,840
will either have to buy another cutter

177
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,240
or buy another tractor and um and vice

178
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,720
versa so you need to when you're buying

179
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,680
a tractor you need to buy something you

180
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,240
know that matches your cutter or buy a

181
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,280
cutter that matches your

182
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,919
tractor a what size bush hog would that

183
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,560
pull I recommend a 5 foot for this this

184
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,319
particular it's about a 35 or 6

185
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,000
horsepower tractor a 5ft bushog or

186
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,639
Cutter does real good on this tractor at

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,039
what point Acres wise would most people

188
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,560
need to step up and get a bigger tractor

189
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,840
a bigger bush hog well I think if you

190
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,240
get up into maybe 20 or 25 or 30 Acres

191
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,840
you know I would look at going like a 50

192
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,800
horse P tractor and may be getting a six

193
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,519
foot cutter and um and if you got you

194
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,399
know 30 or 40 acres I would probably try

195
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,919
to go to a 50 or 60 horsepower tractor

196
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:42,039
and get a seven or eight foot cutter

197
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:45,440
so it's just according to how much time

198
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,440
you want to spend out there using a

199
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,880
cutter now this would be like if

200
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,880
somebody had 100 acres they needed to

201
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,200
keep bush hog yes this would be a pretty

202
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,200
good tractor it

203
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,720
would what what would you look for on a

204
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,760
bigger tractor that you wouldn't what

205
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,560
what what would be the issues specific

206
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,160
to a higher horsepower tractor basically

207
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,399
the same thing applies to a big tractor

208
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,480
that does a small tractor you look under

209
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:15,640
it for oil leaks and

210
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,040
uh course this tractor uh it has a on it

211
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,600
and I would always get in there and make

212
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,480
sure the air conditioner works properly

213
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:27,079
on it this tractor here um it comes with

214
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,760
a with two PTO Shades in it so you can

215
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:31,959
use uh

216
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,200
two

217
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:38,880
different uh implements on it this is a

218
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,640
th000 RPM shave which is a 21 spline

219
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,880
this is a 540 shaft with a six spline

220
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,560
which gives you an option over the other

221
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,079
tractor you can

222
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,880
use

223
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:52,880
uh either one on it so you don't have to

224
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,959
worry about that this tractor has got

225
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,160
hydraulic dual hydraulic

226
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,040
vials uh like you can put a front end

227
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,760
loader on this tractor and you already

228
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,079
got your vial set up on it uh like

229
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,120
pulling a big hay roller most people's

230
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,720
got a 15t backwing cutter that they use

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,680
with this type tractor uh it's a real

232
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,760
good bush hog tractor it's it keeps you

233
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:19,560
clean uh inside uh you don't have to

234
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,560
worry about eating dust all day long and

235
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,480
it's also

236
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,279
cool in today's market you can spend

237
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,360

238
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:34,040

can it's a variety of tractors out there

243
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,279
in this range and I tell people all time

244
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,320
you buy a good used tractor 10 years

245
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,360
from now it'll make you money because

246
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,839
they go up every year because the new

247
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,720
ones go up every year so they won't lose

248
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,680
any money you can always turn around and

249
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,480
resell it if you'll just take care of it

250
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,760
