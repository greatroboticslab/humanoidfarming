  "text": "hi this video is about how i set up the 750 grain drill to drill kern's a perennial wheatgrass kernsa is a pretty fluffy and a tiny grain it's going to get drilled a half inch deep on seven and a half inch centers and i've got 24 acres and there's 411 pounds of seed which is 288 pounds of pure live seed so that comes out to 17 pounds an acre that's a pretty tiny amount to put down and i and i need to be pretty accurate about this because i don't have a lot of way to get extra seeds so i want to be as precise as possible this drill doesn't do very well on low seed amounts per acre there's an adjustment here it goes from 0 to 60 which moves the seed cups and opens them and closes them i ended up the final setting on this side was at 14 and the other side was 16 in order to balance both sides without the half speed gears that would have been down at not even half it would have been six or seven and it's really hard to meter it out so the first thing i did with the half speed gears once i had that in i blocked off all of the seed cups except for four here is one of them and i put a bag over each of the four there's one there one there and then there's two more on the other side and then what i would do at least to get a rough sense of it first i used the wheat settings in the book and that was they suggested i should be down at four or five but i ended up being at eight or nine initially and my initial uh run on this i ended up with eight seven eight point seven pounds per acre so what i would do i would take the weight of the four bags net and would weigh them on the scale and i would i would net them out in here and multiply by six there's six there's 24 rows on this i'm only monitoring four i'm collecting from four so multiply that by six and the way i covered the distance at first was to jack up this rear wheel underneath here you got to get on this piece of tube jack it up and then the book tells you how many revolutions equal one acre in this case it's 363. i ended up doing 36 and a third spinning it by hand as fast as i could to replicate the speed i'd be traveling i did that two or three times and and actually i did it once twice and ended up first with i was getting closer and closer i can't see what this one is here but i ended up at 14.9 then i bumped it up a little bit and then finally what i ended up doing was going out in the field with all four of these things bagged and each time you have to reinitialize it to to make sure there's enough seed in the tube you know so you're getting a full shot from the time you start at zero till the time you end up but i went out into the field and with the gps i just made a line and then i came back and i monitored that distance and at the real time speed that i was going and i'm happy with where that ends up i meant according to this 15.75 pounds per acre and i'd rather be a little bit under than over i've also got a loop monitor in here that supposedly will keep an eye on things for me it seems like a little bit of overkill but i wanted to do a good job with the rate on this because there's such a light amount going down [Music] jacking it up and spinning is no fun i ended up using a stubby bottle jack and there's a um this piece of tube right under here was right under that tip ideally i would like to been on the on the round tube housing but there was no way to get under there and cup that i found one video with a guy used a um automotive jack with that little cup on it and he went right under that that spot right there so well i'll do the bottle jack on that it seemed to do okay a few times that i had it up in the air and the other thing too with these drills of course you've got to have the arm has got to be in the ground in order for this mechanism to engage so that these these rocker shafts have got to be rotated down so i just ended up opening up the the pressure valve and letting the valves sink down that causes the shaft back there that black shaft to rotate 45 degrees and then when that rotates there's an arm that's bolted to it right there that comes up here to this clutch i think it's a what i call clutch with those two offset plates in it and then that rotates those so they line up and then this outer shaft here driven by a chain from that back wheel will actually connect with this shaft over here which then goes back inside this outer shaft over to this gearbox and it goes from down here i'll show you all the work i did i i the solution i came up with for this it's just ugly you see i had to cut that corner out there because these are the half speed gears but in order to get this gear off that's on that shaft i mentioned that's got two sides to it that are you know the internal and external sleeve so that's being driven over here by that shaft when those clutch plates engage and then that drives this bigger gear which in turn that shaft right there i don't think point got too blurry am i going too fast well that's the shaft here the upper shaft for the seat cups i don't know what's going on with this camera i guess i got a time limit or a memory limit or something well you're going to get an impressionistic view thanks for uh paying attention hopefully this helps somebody if they got to do kearns uh but you're going to see i had to chop that hole there because that spur gear want me to get it off and just come straight out and i ended up using an air hammer to drive that roll pin out that's in there that's holding it on the shaft with a roll pin uh chisel rope in uh air hammer but all in all looking good and here it is first of september should drill this and it'll dry out in a day or so bye for now",
