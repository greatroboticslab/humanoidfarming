00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,560
today i'm going to demonstrate a simple

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,040
way to install backflow prevention

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,000
between the faucet and a fertigation

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,320
feeder

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,920
the backflow preventer or tank valve is

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,799
a critical piece of the irrigation

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,639
system

8
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,519
the backflow preventer is true to its

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,199
name

10
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,039
it prevents irrigation water from

11
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,560
re-entering or back flowing into the

12
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,199
water supply

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,039
backflow sometimes called back siphoning

14
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,880
occurs when there is a negative pressure

15
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,400
or pressure loss on the supply side of

16
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
the irrigation system

17
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,000
without a functioning backflow

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,120
prevention there is a risk of

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,800
contaminating the water supply

20
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,320
it is important to make sure that you

21
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,719
install the backflow preventer in the

22
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,399
correct direction when installing it

23
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,160
make sure to look for the manufacturer's

24
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,760
stamped directional arrow that is

25
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,079
located on the side of the backflip

26
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,079
event

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,360
the backflow preventer can be installed

28
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,280
using a glue fitting as shown or as a

29
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,600
threaded fitting depending on the model

30
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,600
that is used

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,760
the arrow is the direction of water

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,600
flowing through the pipe if the backflow

33
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,200
preventer is installed backwards then it

34
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,200
will stop the flow of water to your

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,200
field

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,400
we hope this video was very useful

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,320
please check out our video series to

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,200
simple irrigation system on a small
