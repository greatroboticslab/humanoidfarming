1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,570
the best practices because farming

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,680
ranches are unique type of business it's

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,570
really kind of simple walk the land real

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,059
estate is a three dimensional product

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,490
many of my younger students and younger

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,190
folks are used to Google Earth and all

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,170
the other wonderful advantages we have

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,529
now with the internet and the web

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,269
however and it's not fun to walk a four

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,279
thousand acre ranch in Rock Springs in

11
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,359
August but you really need to walk to

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,920
land and understand the

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,960
three-dimensional aspect of that which

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,880
applies to all real estate you have to

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,320
realize upfront it's not the simple

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,840
farmer that's out there playing with

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,280
mule it's a whole new world it's

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,000
extremely complex

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,370
you've got mineral rights water rights

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,920
leases crop leases all kinds of things

21
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,070
that that make it important to you more

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,160
more involved in details I'm dr. Charles

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,890
Porter I've been a real estate agent

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,680
broker since 1978 that's almost 40 years

25
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,809
I have a PhD in economics in business

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,090
I've written a number of books about

27
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,589
water rights nor do I teach it say in

28
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,170
every University but also I've been

29
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,360
named as an expert witness and testified

30
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,200
in over 600 cases around the country of

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,580
30 years

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,590
I think one of the big reasons that

33
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,740
farmer Ranch products have soared so

34
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,979
greatly since 2007 2007 is really the

35
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,810
time that our our world kind of changed

36
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,720
so much as far as in New York and

37
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,970
finances at that point even though we

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,670
see this 2008 2007 when the money

39
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,950
started to really tighten up as interest

40
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,500
rates were suppressed especially the

41
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,600
tenure to bill rate went down based upon

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,020
interest rate controls by the government

43
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,170
all of a sudden farming ranch became not

44
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,979
a safe haven for money but also a

45
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,049
position that that you couldn't get

46
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,240
returns anywhere else the other thing is

47
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,119
there's a tremendous tax advantage if

48
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,640
you are able to acquire an agricultural

49
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,680
valuation in places like her County

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,040
reduces your Avalon tax obligation by

51
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,770
97% fiduciary duties are also found

52
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,720
actually three times in the

53
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,569
a real estate commission first in the

54
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,459
canons of ethics secondly under five

55
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:13,660
thirty five point two of the rules a

56
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:17,030
broker has the very highest fiduciary

57
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,709
that ought to wake everybody up the

58
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,420
third time trek tells you we have

59
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:22,640
fiduciary duties is five thirty five

60
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,319
point one five six in the rules which

61
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,420
says all agents have to be sure you do

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,010
so I've always understood in been talk

63
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,180
today they say you tell you three times

64
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,370
your fiduciary duties

65
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,470
you've got fiduciary duties above all

66
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,660
else we'll put our clients interests

67
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,370
above our personal interests and I think

68
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,860
that's why we're very unique and people

69
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,630
can tell me for those of you that want

70
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,090
