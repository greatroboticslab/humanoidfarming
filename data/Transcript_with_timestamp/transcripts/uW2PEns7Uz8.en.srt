1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,000
so you're thinking about wanting to own

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,600
the greatest tractor ever made well I

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:16,680
think you're in the right

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:19,119
[Music]

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,439
place you know these old Ford tractors

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,840
are pretty cool they've really lasted

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,640
the test of time and you know there's

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,359
still a lot of them around as a matter

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,000
of fact pretty sure it was the uh most

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,360
sold track

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,760
ever so that's pretty

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,920
cool a few years ago when I bought this

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,320
one I ended up paying 1700 for it and I

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,120
thought it was a pretty good deal I went

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,399
over and looked at it at the guy's house

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,520
that I was buying it from and we uh we

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,760
started it up and drove it around a

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,800
little bit and everything seemed to

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,840
function just fine and you know that's

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,000
kind of what I was worried about is does

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,440
it start do the Hydraulics work you know

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,760
and beyond that I knew there'd be repair

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,960
I mean it's 70 plus years

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,880
old you know and what's crazy about

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,280
spending the 1700 for it is uh if I

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,560
could have just been lucky enough to be

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,360
born maybe back when it was made around

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,320
1949 I could have had the luxury of only

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,880
spending about 1,400 to buy it brand

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,119
new it's amazing how much they've not

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,320
only held but increased their value all

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,320
these years

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,320
cleans up pretty good think I need new

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,280
tires been like that since I got it the

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,960
earlier models the 9 NS if you'd have

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,280
been old enough to buy one of those

37
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,079
brand new you could have done it for

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,200
about

39
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:53,880
$650 crazy you can't hardly do anything

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,880
for $650

41
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,880
now you know the truth is just like

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,439
anything else that you own there's going

43
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,719
to be maintenance and maintenance cost

44
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,759
money but honestly the maintenance on

45
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,239
this is not really any more than a car

46
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,959
you know oil

47
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:13,080
changes um hydraulic fluid changes you

48
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,319
know think of hydraulic fluid change run

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,319
you probably about

50
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:23,319
75 thanks for your help run you about

51
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,519
$75 for the uh tractor fluid you know

52
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,599
and then your oil changes just typical

53
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,080
oil and filter for that so but you're

54
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:31,640
going to have maintenance and you're

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,000
going to learn a lot that's that's one

56
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,400
of the important

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,879
things I had it for a year before I knew

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,879
it did

59
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,000
that pretty slick idea especially when

60
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,000
it's raining out you don't want a wet

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,640
butt you know so what are these old

62
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:53,319
tractors

63
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,200
worth you know or should I say what what

64
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:59,920
should you expect to pay well like I

65
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,800
said I paid 1,700 for this one I've seen

66
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,920
them as low as 500 well and almost free

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,599
I guess but they don't

68
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,080
run and I seen them as high as about

69
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,440
6,000 but I got to be honest that one

70
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,239
was completely restored looks brand new

71
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,560
probably better than brand new all of

72
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,560
the fancy stickers and everything on it

73
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,000
that you could possibly imagine and who

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,360
knows if that person even got 6,000 for

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,480
it but that sure was a nice looking

76
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,879
tractor but I think the thing is that

77
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,280
you got to remember is that you know

78
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,879
$1,400 in

79
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,280
1949 well that's going to be about

80
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:41,879
$188,000 now adjusted for inflation that

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,760
is and if you kind of look around you

82
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:48,760
know most of the tractors that are about

83
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,560
$188,000 nowadays are essentially this

84
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,159
you know some of them have buckets on

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,720
them and different things like that and

86
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,159
you can get Buckets for these as well

87
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,879
but those are some of the things that I

88
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,040
think you need to consider you know and

89
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,200
what are you going to learn with a new

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,239
tractor you know how to do donuts and

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,519
drive it around in circles you know with

92
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,959
an old one you get experience you know

93
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,400
you get to Tinker with it and tear it

94
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,439
all apart that's half the fun can be

95
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,160
frustrating at times but you know that's

96
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:18,479
most things in life it's got to look at

97
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,560
the positive be happy for the times when

98
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,400
it's actually

99
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,280
running you know when you're going to

100
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,800
have maintenance they call this thing

101
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,560
here a carburetor you know and I've had

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,440
that thing tore apart more times than I

103
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
care to even remember

104
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,080
you know but now the tractor's running

105
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,880
great and heck I'm kind of at the point

106
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,240
where I'm scared to even touch

107
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,120
it and if you've been paying real close

108
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,639
attention you've probably noticed that

109
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,039
uh this one here has a alternator on it

110
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,560
well they didn't come originally with

111
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:50,320
alternators they came with generators

112
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,880
and the reason this one has the

113
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,960
alternator on it is because I upgraded

114
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,240
to the 12vt system and you know looking

115
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,440
back to be honest I I probably wouldn't

116
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,160
have converted it to the 12 Vol system

117
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,759
over the 6vt in hindsight I don't think

118
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,479
it makes much difference but at the time

119
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,639
I was looking for something to do that I

120
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,160
felt comfortable with and the electrical

121
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,680
part was a lot more Comfort than you

122
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,720
know tearing apart carburetors or

123
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,440
manifolds or you know anything like that

124
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,360
you know and the crazy thing is you know

125
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,680
as many of them as they made they're all

126
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,520
just a little bit different they got

127
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,240
just a little bit different setup and

128
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,600
design and a little bit different look

129
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,039
to them you know different

130
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,360
transmissions and things like that never

131
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:44,840
really seen any that are absolutely

132
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,520
identical whether it's the dash uh the

133
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,759
gauges you

134
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,360
know previous things the owners

135
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,160
did you know what happened to it all

136
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,800
those years you know if you look at the

137
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,919
inside of this tank here or the H or if

138
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,120
you look at the inside of this hood here

139
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,199
at one point some somebody thought they

140
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,319
should have painted it yellow I don't

141
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,080
know what the heck they were

142
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,919
thinking you

143
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,520
know safety wasn't as big of a concern

144
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:14,000
back in the day as it seems to be

145
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,599
now these tractors can be pretty

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,199
dangerous this was the very first thing

147
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:22,360
that I bought once I took ownership of

148
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,199
this tractor this is a cover for the PTO

149
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,680
and it keeps that thing covered cuz

150
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,319
there's a little uh deal in there that

151
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,840
likes to spin when the PTO is turned on

152
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,479
and if you were to get an article of

153
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:37,199
clothing hooked into that or your shirt

154
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:39,759
or your hair or any other type of uh

155
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,479
maybe strap or chain that would not be a

156
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,560
good day you can uh ask my

157
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,840
great-grandfather about that

158
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,520
one I will uh put a link down in the

159
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,039
description to a video talking about

160
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,400
that you know while I'm back here I'll

161
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,199
talk about this back bucket um I had a

162
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,639
guy on one of the videos David he asked

163
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,520
a question about how I did it see uh

164
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,720
this uh this bucket wasn't originally

165
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,400
this design it originally faced forward

166
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,000
as all of the other Deerborn models uh

167
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,800
just like it did and I decided I wanted

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,199
one that I could back into instead of

169
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,919
drive into so I cut some pieces off of

170
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,639
it and welded some other pieces on and

171
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,360
this is what I ended up with so you can

172
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,199
see right here I welded these ears on

173
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,120
and uh have them back so that the arms

174
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,319
can come down and get hooked up on both

175
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,479
sides and then I took this top link and

176
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,840
I uh cut it and put this section in the

177
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,000
middle so that it was long long enough

178
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:38,360
to reach and then I uh welded on this uh

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,400
top link uh deal here and uh it seems to

180
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,680
work pretty good but uh I also I I cut

181
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,159
off a piece here on the front and uh and

182
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,199
used that somewhere else I'll show you

183
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:50,000
in a second but uh I'll take you over

184
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,159
and show you what it should originally

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,720
look like so you can kind of get a

186
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,680
better idea of what I cut off and where

187
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,560
I welded stuff on you can see here this

188
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,240
is the piece that I took off of the

189
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,039
another one and cut

190
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,720
up and you can see back here if I move

191
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:09,800
some of the the weeds out of the

192
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,720
way maybe not there we go this is where

193
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,520
I welded those ears on the back so that

194
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,759
the arms could come down and hook

195
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,240
on so even if you own one of these

196
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,319
tractors already but uh you'd like to

197
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,960
see something specific on my tractor and

198
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,800
how it maybe differs a little bit from

199
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,159
yours you know shoot me a comment down

200
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,080
in the comment section and if I can't

201
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,599
answer it there I'll probably throw it

202
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,760
in the middle of a video somewhere you

203
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,360
know some of these things about these

204
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,320
old tractors is kind of learning by

205
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,800
doing and I'll tell you this this right

206
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,240
here this is the dipstick for your

207
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,800
hydraulic fluid

208
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,800
and long before you'll ever even get a

209
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,720
chance to check that for the first time

210
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,640
you're going to sit down on this seat

211
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,880
put your heel down on that and bust this

212
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,519
little handle clean off not exactly sure

213
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,320
what they were thinking with that

214
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:00,000
design but if you like

215
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,320
tinkering and having fun these are

216
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,959
pretty good

217
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,040
tractors you

218
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:09,519
know I think 26 horsepower was what they

219
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,200
were originally designed with which in

220
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,760
modern times doesn't sound like a whole

221
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
lot of power but I think you'll be

222
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,560
surprised you'll get yourself scared

223
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,079
more than once or twice on it so if

224
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,480
you're interested in getting yourself an

225
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:27,600
old tractor I'd say with the ford8 in

226
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,680
the greatest tractor ever made I don't

227
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,240
think you can go wrong if you're

228
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,640
interested in annual maintenance on

229
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,440
these I'll tell you what I got a few

230
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,440
videos that I made on changing the oil

231
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
and changing the hydraulic fluid and

232
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,399
I'll put those uh videos down in the

233
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,079
description down below otherwise I

234
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,120
appreciate you watching today and uh

235
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,839
hope maybe you learn something and now

236
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,440
you can go out and get yourself a Ford

237
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,839
tractor just like this

238
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,839
one hopefully

239
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,330
better come on start

240
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,330
