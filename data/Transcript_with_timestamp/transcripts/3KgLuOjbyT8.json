  "text": "the ministry of agriculture fisheries food security and rural development in collaboration with world university service of canada have engaged local farmers in a series of training workshops on the role of vegetable grafting in climate smart agriculture strategies according to crop protection officer johnny smith this intervention will facilitate a more reliable and consistent supply of produce to the market so the current grafting training covers a theoretical session and it covers a practical session so we have the morning we normally start at nine and we run until one we start with lectures on the work that has been done locally on grafting vegetables so we've looked at grafting tomatoes on various root stocks we've grafted sweet peppers on different root stocks and we've looked at how they perform against biotic stresses and abiotic stresses so we're going to now present that information that research to the farmers so that they could see the possibilities that they could gain from actually practicing vegetable grafting vegetable grafting helps in reducing losses and the amount of money spent in managing disease problems it gives the farmer a better chance at being successful in the enterprise and in overall production it also promotes less pesticide use what ipm tries to do is to discourage the immediate normally farmers run to chemicals immediately first stop so we tried to put chemicals at the as the last option so vegetable grafting now would be one of your first options so if you have a problem a biotic problem a bacteria fungus in your soil you can use this technique to protect your crop okay so if you're not using the technique normally the crop would you'd lost maybe 50 of your crop actual plants so that means your yield would be decreased and that directly affects food security because you you have less coming from your farm the farmer also has to spend more in terms of management so he has more pesticide to buy he has to pay workers to apply that pesticide and you have more and then even after you've done that sometimes you're not successful in managing that disease so it costs more and the farmer is experiencing losses the crop protection officers indicated that the response from participating farmers have been very encouraging and they have recommended varieties of vegetables that can be used for grafting just as impressive farmers have already been applying the principles that have been taught from the ministry of agriculture fisheries food security and rural development i'm ryan o'brien",
