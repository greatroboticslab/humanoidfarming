00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,970
speed the future and the USAID Bureau

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,889
for food security I would like to

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,870
welcome you to our webinar today on

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,230
measuring performance and Agricultural

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,150
Extension a common metrics framework my

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,400
name is Julie McCarty and I'm with the

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,199
USA Bureau for food security and I'll be

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,029
your webinar facilitator today so you'll

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,210
hear my voice periodically especially

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,740
during our question-and-answer session

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,529
before we dive into the content I'd like

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,440
to go over a few housekeeping items to

14
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,180
orient you to the webinar first and many

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,829
of you have done this already please do

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,350
use the chat box to introduce yourselves

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,700
and let us know where you're coming from

18
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,890
the chat box is your main way to

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,840
communicate today and we encourage you

20
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,930
to use it to post your questions at any

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,539
point to share resources and to discuss

22
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,800
this topic with your colleagues we'll be

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,289
collecting your questions throughout the

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,120
webinar and we'll try to answer some of

25
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,559
them along the way in the chat box and

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,410
we'll hold the rest until after the

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,449
presentation you'll see that the slides

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,070
are currently available for download and

29
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,900
the little box in the bottom left of

30
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,180
your screen and they're also some

31
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,110
recommended links so we encourage you to

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,790
explore those throughout the webinar and

33
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,409
lastly we are recording this webinar and

34
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,299
we'll e-mail you the recording the

35
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,400
transcript and some additional resources

36
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,409
once they are ready and they'll also be

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,030
posted on the iGrow links website so

38
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,090
you'll be able to forward this on to

39
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,150
your colleagues as desired all right

40
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,070
let's talk about extensions as many of

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,049
you know Agricultural Extension and

42
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,150
advisory services provide essential

43
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,680
support to small holder farmers by

44
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,420
providing them with the knowledge and

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,970
tools about modern practices and

46
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,799
technologies by facilitating co-learning

47
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,079
within communities and by increasing

48
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,750
access to finance and market solutions

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,700
among other roles and as such AG

50
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,439
extension is very fundamental to see the

51
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,320
futures work with small holder farming

52
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,119
communities I expect that many of you

53
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,280
have joined today because you see value

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,439
in having an established set of metrics

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,329
to compare and contrast the performance

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,390
of extension systems across different

57
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,399
countries and contexts and feed the

58
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,489
future of developing local extension

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,140
capacity or elect projects as leading an

60
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,180
initiative to develop a common

61
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,800
work for extension metrics and we're

62
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,380
excited to have three speakers on hand

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,690
today to discuss this so I'll go ahead

64
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,260
and introduce our speakers and then I

65
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,930
will hand it over to them all right so

66
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,490
first up will be Kristin Davis who is a

67
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,140
senior research fellow with the

68
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,520
International Food Policy Research

69
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:37,380
Institute and has been there since 2004

70
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,330
her research involves research and

71
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,970
capacity strengthening on Agricultural

72
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,160
Extension education and agricultural

73
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,800
innovation systems and she is currently

74
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,900
the project director for the USA funded

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,900
project developing local extension

76
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,989
capacity or a d-league

77
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:57,480
next up will be David Spielman who is a

78
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:00,180
senior research fellow also at spring

79
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,640
and has also been there since 2004 and

80
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,550
he leaves the Institute's program on

81
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,940
science technology and innovation policy

82
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:11,820
and then we will also have Judy Paine

83
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,800
who was USAID's digital solutions

84
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,380
advisor for agriculture until just

85
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,030
recently in 2017 and is now an

86
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,310
independent consultant with the same

87
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,930
focus and she's currently helping us aid

88
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:28,799
missions and their projects use digital

89
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:31,260
tools to increase thank you very much

90
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,540
Julie and good day to all of you thank

91
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,430
you so much for joining this webinar and

92
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,100
I hope we'll have plenty of time for

93
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:42,360
discussion so I'm going to try to

94
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,700
advance the slides here and start with

95
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,040
an introduction to the topic and I'd

96
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,079
like to give you some background on the

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,840
initiative that Julie mentioned to

98
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:55,950
develop a common framework for extension

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,739
metrics to date no common framework

100
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,140
exists but we do see value in having a

101
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,989
common set of metrics to consistently

102
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,069
assess extension performance across

103
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,900
countries and also across contexts

104
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,930
I think a set of common metrics would

105
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:15,739
help us to share and adapt learning to

106
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:18,410
guide policymakers and funders

107
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:21,560
and implementers as well with regard to

108
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:27,830
how to invest in extension also just to

109
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:30,110
innovate and to maximize impact as I

110
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,449
said there is no common framework but

111
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,539
where the initiative started then was

112
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:37,610
with the best fit framework which is a

113
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,590
conceptual framework developed by the

114
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,820
International Food Policy Research

115
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:46,009
Institute the best fit framework

116
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:48,020
suggests an impact chain approach but

117
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:51,710
first let me explain a little bit more

118
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:54,050
what this framework is all about the

119
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,180
premise of the best fit framework is

120
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,539
there is no one-size-fits-all solution

121
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:03,050
to extension and advisory services and

122
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:06,470
we need local context specific and

123
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:10,009
customized or best fit solutions to

124
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:12,110
designing impactful extension how does

125
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,630
this work we start with the extension

126
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,659
system characteristics and these have to

127
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,180
be adopted or fit to the frame

128
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:23,599
conditions and you can see the frame

129
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,840
conditions here surrounding the box in

130
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:29,599
green it's the political system whether

131
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,570
it's centralized or decentralized it's

132
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:35,180
the farming systems and production input

133
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:39,830
and output markets it's the business

134
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,509
environment and civil society etc just a

135
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,949
little pause here Julie to make sure

136
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:51,139
everything's working fine no problems

137
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:53,539
good gonna continue great so let's dig a

138
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,909
little deeper here into the

139
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:58,490
characteristics of the extension system

140
00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:00,669
and how they lead to performance in the

141
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,509
previous slide here I showed you how the

142
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,509
characteristics lead to performance

143
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:07,719
which lead to outcomes or changes in

144
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:10,370
behavior and then ultimate impacts

145
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:12,680
digging a little deeper into the

146
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,139
extension system characteristics and how

147
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,840
they affect the performance we first of

148
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:19,430
all have governance and management

149
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,150
structures things like human resource

150
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,030
management

151
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:26,390
and the incentives and career paths if

152
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:29,450
any monitoring and evaluation we then

153
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:32,240
have both organizational and individual

154
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,610
capacities of the extension services and

155
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,590
for individual agents this includes

156
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,320
technical skills but also your

157
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:42,110
functional or soft skills as well which

158
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,030
they need for their job and then we also

159
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,340
have the methods which characterize

160
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,980
extension services the ways in which

161
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,540
extension interacts with farmers

162
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,600
depending on their audience whether

163
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,130
they're trying to reach women or youth

164
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,720
teach something complicated where you

165
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,910
might use farmer field schools or

166
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,810
something where you use radio or

167
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:04,430
demonstrations all of these

168
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,770
characteristics which as I said are fit

169
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,200
to the frame conditions then affect the

170
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,000
performance of the systems and by

171
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,440
performance we're talking about things

172
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,580
like quality relevance timeliness demand

173
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,280
Drive effectiveness and efficiency but

174
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,410
where the best fit framework falls short

175
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,480
is in establishing a common set of

176
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,130
indicators against which to measure

177
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,560
performance so that's what we want to

178
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:33,670
talk about today and that brings us to

179
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,550
the initiative for a common framework

180
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:39,550
for metrics the initiative as Julie

181
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,260
mentioned is led by the Feed the Future

182
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,210
developing local extension capacity

183
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,940
together with Bill and Melinda Gates

184
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:50,300
Foundation the World Bank and of course

185
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,800
USAID and this initiative came out of

186
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,440
some joint discussions on how to

187
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,900
transform extension globally including

188
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,520
things like pluralism and the use of

189
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,850
information and communication

190
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,860
technologies or ICT there is a task

191
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,960
force within the initiative that is

192
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,970
working on this framework for common

193
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,270
metrics which will be discussed actually

194
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:13,940
in a face-to-face meeting in Uganda in

195
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,670
February 2019 and we're hoping to bring

196
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:19,400
together some potential adopters of the

197
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,050
framework especially government's to see

198
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,380
how they're going to use the framework

199
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,990
and what we can do with it the task

200
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,670
force up front decided that the metrics

201
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,550
we're going to look at are going to be

202
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,190
aspirational which means data that we

203
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,140
want to

204
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,690
not necessarily that we know we can get

205
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,120
but also we'll focus on the public

206
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,400
sector but within a pluralistic context

207
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,590
and perhaps with modules for further

208
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:48,270
users like the private sector and civil

209
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:51,390
society what have we done to date as the

210
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:54,590
extension metrics taskforce we've come

211
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:57,480
up with a set of definitions of terms

212
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,700
we've come up with a framework for the

213
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,370
common metrics that includes outcome

214
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:06,090
pillars or goals of extension the target

215
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:08,700
audience and the domains across which we

216
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:11,400
would like to measure extension and then

217
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,400
we've taken and mapped potential metrics

218
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,860
or data or indicators across the

219
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,380
framework across the pillars the target

220
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,270
audience and the domains to identify

221
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,860
gaps and overlaps and I'm going to cover

222
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:28,350
each of one of these one by one

223
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:30,930
very quickly we have to find extension

224
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,510
and advisory services broadly and in a

225
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,670
pluralistic sense to be all of the

226
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,370
services and information needed and

227
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,670
demanded by producers that is aimed at

228
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,200
developing their technical

229
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,820
organizational and management capacity

230
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,310
and empowering them to make better

231
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:51,690
decisions with regard to their

232
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:54,090
agricultural enterprise we then looked

233
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,700
at the ultimate goals or the outcome

234
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,500
pillars that most extension services

235
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,470
have they have one or more of these

236
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,360
goals one of these is with regard to

237
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,610
productivity and income

238
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,950
this means that producers are reaching

239
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,560
their max maximum productivity and

240
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:14,790
income potential from the agricultural

241
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,760
activities a second goal many extension

242
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,910
programs have is sustainable resilience

243
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,550
where producers mitigate adapt to and

244
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,070
recover from shocks and stresses in a

245
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,990
way that reduces chronic vulnerability

246
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:31,260
while at the same time ensuring

247
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:34,140
environmental sustainability and then a

248
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,540
third pillar is surrounding empowerment

249
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,210
and equity and here we're saying that

250
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,350
all producers including those that are

251
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:45,240
marginalized or vulnerable the poor

252
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:48,209
sometimes women youth pastor

253
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,570
lists all of these people have access to

254
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:54,750
fair agricultural opportunities to

255
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:57,300
agency and to human capital in order to

256
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,760
make better farming decisions so those

257
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,680
are our pillars looking at the target

258
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,300
audience I said we're going to focus on

259
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,600
the public sector this is your

260
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,610
government's your public research

261
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,740
organisations your policymakers but we

262
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,950
also think this framework might be

263
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,510
applicable to the private sector

264
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:18,330
agribusinesses private service providers

265
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,339
and then broadly defined to civil

266
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:24,240
society as well these include your

267
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:27,050
donors nonprofits and NGOs cooperatives

268
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,330
and farming farmer organizations and

269
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:35,700
then the last area we looking at is the

270
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:37,410
domains within the extension system we

271
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,649
start with the systems which are your

272
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,959
overall extension structures the

273
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,750
institutions networks and incentive

274
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,100
things like linkages between

275
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,020
organizations or policies that guide

276
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,260
extension or even your share of the

277
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:54,660
public budget the second area is that of

278
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,060
inputs these are the resources that are

279
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,390
used to implement extension activities

280
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,279
like your extension agent workforce the

281
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:06,209
government budget per household and

282
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:08,520
things like that the third domain is

283
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:10,890
that of delivery the processes and

284
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,950
actions taken to achieve outputs and

285
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,260
deliver or achieve outcomes and this is

286
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:19,680
your organization and management Quality

287
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,270
Assurance training or even use of ICT

288
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,959
information and communication

289
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,910
technologies we then have your outputs

290
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,100
which are the most immediate set of

291
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,620
accomplishments necessary but not

292
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,350
sufficient to produce the outcomes which

293
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,320
are your changes in behavior things like

294
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:40,200
the households reached are included

295
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,510
within the outputs and then lastly we

296
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,700
have outcomes these are as I said your

297
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,149
changes in behavior these are immediate

298
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,470
intermediate observable and measurable

299
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:52,620
changes that can be attributed to

300
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:55,650
extension and can result in ultimate

301
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,970
impacts things like adoption change in

302
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,579
behavior change in attitude

303
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,199
knowledge there's one area we did not

304
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:04,569
include and it would be interesting to

305
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,490
discuss and that is the ultimate impacts

306
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:08,560
that's mentioned here these are very

307
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,410
difficult to measure and also difficult

308
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,870
to attribute to extension programs and

309
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:18,339
Judy and David might discuss that

310
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:20,350
further we'll see but any arm have done

311
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,629
here is to give you some background on

312
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,759
the extension metrics initiative and a

313
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:28,209
quick overview of what we've done in

314
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:30,160
terms of definitions and the start of

315
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:32,769
the common framework the outcome pillars

316
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,199
the target audience and the domains and

317
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:38,050
with that I'd like to turn it over to my

318
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,850
colleague dr. David Spellman to start to

319
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:48,040
talk about the challenges of extension

320
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:51,699
metrics Thanks all right thanks Kristin

321
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,189
I hope everybody can still hear me it's

322
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:55,750
great to have such a large audience on

323
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:58,120
Agri links with an interesting extension

324
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,370
metrics and it's very consistent as this

325
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,620
large audience with the evolution of

326
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,029
thinking in many quarters on extension

327
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,100
you know in which we're moving from

328
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:09,309
what's historically been a very strong

329
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,959
focus on research metrics that is the

330
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:13,240
upstream source of Science and

331
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,610
Technology for agricultural growth and

332
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,639
transformation to a new and very much

333
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:21,009
complementary focus on the last mile and

334
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,259
the downstream solutions for getting

335
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:25,689
products and services to people which

336
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:28,269
includes information and extension

337
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:32,980
recommendations so you know quite

338
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:34,839
naturally we want to have indicators

339
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:38,170
benchmarks and baselines to gauge

340
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,699
progress on this front on our sort of

341
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:43,800
investments or our programs or our

342
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:46,660
projects in extension but let me offer a

343
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,699
quick sort of reality check there are

344
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,829
some fundamental challenges in measuring

345
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:52,089
extension so let's start with you know

346
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:55,300
what you might call sort of a an

347
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:57,309
epistemological debate at a very basic

348
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,160
level it can be argued that extension

349
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:02,649
cannot be isolated or identified at

350
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,439
least not in the way we define extension

351
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:07,540
in our theory of change that Kristin

352
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:09,399
presented in the earlier slides Emily

353
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,540
let's face it do we really know what

354
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,280
individuals employed by the Agricole

355
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,680
chiral service organization are doing

356
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,390
are they providing farmers with advice

357
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,120
or are they doing other things

358
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,100
monitoring crop production distributing

359
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,790
fertilizer and other inputs collecting

360
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:29,450
on overdue loans and so on an even

361
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:32,180
extension can be isolated or identified

362
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:35,240
can it be quantified can quantitative

363
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:38,150
measures adequately explain a complex

364
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,910
system that is specific to farming

365
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:46,100
systems or Agri ecology society culture

366
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:47,840
economy and so on and even if it can be

367
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,930
quantified are we sure we have a

368
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:54,050
complete understanding of how extension

369
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,000
works are we sure that extension leads

370
00:15:54,050 --> 00:16:01,100
to better farmers or do better farmers

371
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,390
simply seek out extension services all

372
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,340
right let me make sure that everybody

373
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:10,910
can still hear me yeah I think I'm good

374
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:12,560
and then continuing this sort of leads

375
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,810
us to the broader debate of wear

376
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,660
indicators matter in our identified

377
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,010
theory of change along with the impact

378
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,930
pathway we have to think carefully about

379
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,600
what we're trying to measure are they

380
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:26,630
proximate input indicators on sort of

381
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,580
the level and reach of extension or are

382
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,250
they more sort of you know distant

383
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,470
outcome indicators such as the causal

384
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,830
relationship between extension and these

385
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,180
productivity income or sustainability

386
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,920
outcomes of the care about we have to

387
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,200
think carefully about the importance of

388
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,910
attributing causality which Kristin

389
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,410
referred to earlier or really

390
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,660
understanding that relationship between

391
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,250
extension on the one hand and those

392
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,890
outcomes of interest that we care about

393
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,260
and trying to demonstrate that they're

394
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:56,030
more than simple correlations and that

395
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,860
we're accounting for confounding factors

396
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:00,820
in other words is there really a link

397
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:03,820
between receiving extension services and

398
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,699
you know improving your crop yields or

399
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:10,250
you know improving the sustainability of

400
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:13,040
farming or improving the welfare or

401
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,370
income of a household or members of that

402
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,449
household it's a tough question

403
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,640
all right but let's put those things

404
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:21,949
aside for a moment and assume that we're

405
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,430
comfortable with the idea the very idea

406
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:29,420
of measuring extension so now we have to

407
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:31,310
select construct and interpret some set

408
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,960
of indicators but there's no an

409
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,360
internationally accepted standard of

410
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,490
what can be classified as say public

411
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,130
spending on extension or who's

412
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:43,970
considered an extension astoria Nagant

413
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:46,460
or how to classify how to classify

414
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:49,310
capital equipment used in extension

415
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,250
service provision so thankfully we have

416
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,870
some precedent to build on here an

417
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,390
analogous set of questions and an

418
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,460
analogous exercise began in the late

419
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:01,940
nineteen eighty in the measurement of

420
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,620
agricultural research it frees

421
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,570
agricultural Science and Technology

422
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,730
indicators for instance collects

423
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,810
compiled and disseminates

424
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,110
internationally comparable data and

425
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:14,240
information on investment in

426
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,970
agricultural research its advantage and

427
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,680
what makes it distinct from the exercise

428
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,960
we're talking about today on extension

429
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,300
is that the a few metrics draw on

430
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,000
comprehensive definitions of what

431
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:28,040
constitutes research that were developed

432
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,490
by the OECD and laid out in their

433
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,170
Frascati manual so maybe in the

434
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,390
measurement of extension we need to

435
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,280
develop something similar maybe it's up

436
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,830
to us to develop that manual or that

437
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,760
guidance on how to measure extension and

438
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:45,650
what constitutes extension so a key

439
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,380
principle of the of the ASCII approach

440
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:51,920
or any approach really is that we need

441
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,660
to measure extension or whatever it is

442
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,320
we're measuring at the point where the

443
00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:00,650
actual action takes place it's the

444
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,690
principle of subsidiarity in asti they

445
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,640
look at the Agricultural Research Center

446
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,340
or Institute or at the university

447
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,680
research program or lab that same

448
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,020
principle applied to extension though is

449
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,600
a bit trickier and what scale -

450
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,460
extension metrics make analytical sense

451
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,040
for data collection or for other

452
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,380
purposes do we measure extension at sort

453
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,750
of the central or federal level or do we

454
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,850
go hunting for data on extension at the

455
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,160
state or provincial level or at the

456
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:30,080
county and district level or even

457
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,780
further down at a very local sort of

458
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,810
village or community level do we measure

459
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:38,000
by geography agro ecology farming system

460
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,960
commodity or value chain those are very

461
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,480
different units of an

462
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,640
and do we focus on measuring public

463
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,220
extension only or do we try to get

464
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,290
proprietary information from private

465
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,550
firms on their customer support and

466
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:54,650
advisory services so all of this

467
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,870
suggests the need for data collection

468
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,880
and I would argue that if we want to

469
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,030
track extension metrics over time and

470
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,090
space which is certainly the the goal of

471
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:07,130
this conversation we need to collect new

472
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,170
data and definitely not repackage

473
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:13,190
existing data but collecting new data

474
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:15,260
costs a lot of money thankfully several

475
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,630
new initiatives out there can help us

476
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:21,830
either by bringing useful data into our

477
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:24,440
reach or by providing us with new data

478
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,090
collection methods for example consider

479
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,310
the World Bank living standards

480
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,830
measurement survey and it's integrated

481
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,930
surveys on agriculture which provides

482
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,000
cross country comparability on questions

483
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,340
such as whether a respondent has met

484
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,980
with an extension officer in the last

485
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,710
year or so or consider the women's

486
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:46,010
empowerment indicators under the women's

487
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:47,630
empowerment in agriculture index has

488
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:51,110
been developed by my colleagues of mine

489
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:53,090
here in history and elsewhere way the

490
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,950
way assembles novel data and analytics

491
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,810
on how men and women live work and

492
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,240
interact in the context of developing

493
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,920
country agriculture and a lot of these

494
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,410
data points could be used to obtain a

495
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:07,370
very valuable gendered perspective on

496
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:10,010
extension provision and performance so

497
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,270
that leads us to what I think is really

498
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,540
the essential question or the biggest

499
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:17,410
challenge can extension metrics actually

500
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:20,360
influence policy change for example by

501
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:23,090
encouraging governments to invest more

502
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:27,800
in extension or to undertake meaningful

503
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:29,660
structural reforms in extension I think

504
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,330
that the world has made tremendous

505
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:34,370
progress in using evidence data evidence

506
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,680
like we're talking about here to advance

507
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,940
policy change but we all know that there

508
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,490
are other factors like political

509
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,160
imperatives that affect policy change

510
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:47,810
much more than simply a set of good

511
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:50,000
metrics more importantly even if we

512
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,800
assume that our metrics have merit we

513
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,340
still need to ask if metrics are the

514
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,770
right

515
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,380
to either a lot of very powerful people

516
00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:00,980
talk about using metrics to name and

517
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,840
shame or rank and spank countries who

518
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,440
don't invest enough in development

519
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,659
priorities but does that get us to the

520
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,760
outcomes we really want you know

521
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:13,070
extension systems are not a competitive

522
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,840
sports league like say the English

523
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,419
Premier League and the standings are

524
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,740
there on the screen in front of you or

525
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,779
the National Football League here in the

526
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,789
United States where team rankings points

527
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:25,909
and other statistics are the very

528
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:27,830
essence of the game a metric has to be

529
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:29,899
actionable to be policy relevant

530
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,450
otherwise how does a policymaker do

531
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:34,760
anything about a low score or a low rank

532
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,950
and a metric also has to be substantive

533
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,380
so that policymakers cannot simply game

534
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:41,659
the system by investing in one topic or

535
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,409
solving one particular problem to

536
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:46,309
somehow move themselves up the ranks

537
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:47,539
there's been a lot of critique of the

538
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:52,090
World Bank's Ease of Doing Business

539
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:55,130
Index or data collection and analysis

540
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:57,100
project along these lines and it's

541
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:01,039
something to think about very carefully

542
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,570
so having said all that I think an

543
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,520
attempt to measure extension is is a

544
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,049
tremendously good idea and we're

545
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,549
fortunate that the Gates Foundation the

546
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:09,500
Bullet Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

547
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:11,240
along with several other key

548
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,549
organizations have taken a stab at this

549
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,980
challenge to guide their own investments

550
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:17,960
and their own grant making so what you

551
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,610
have in front of you is a list of key

552
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,110
indicators that the foundation is

553
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,940
considering for their extension

554
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,220
dashboard they form what I would argue

555
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,950
is a good starting point for any country

556
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:31,610
or program considering an investment in

557
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:33,140
developing local extension capacity I'll

558
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,090
walk through them very quickly for you

559
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,450
and we can talk more about them later if

560
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,970
you like

561
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:42,529
they are for instance the share of

562
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:44,929
public budget spent on extension and we

563
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:47,240
would normalize that by dividing it by

564
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:50,960
the total agricultural budget so sort of

565
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,880
a percentage-wise intensity measure we

566
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,600
could also normalize that on a per

567
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,980
household basis an interesting metric

568
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,049
that they're proposing is financial

569
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,299
incentives for extension agents such as

570
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:04,610
the ratio of an extension agent daily

571
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:08,179
wage to let's say a royalty

572
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:10,519
daily wage continuous improvement

573
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:12,019
processes so the proportion of extension

574
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:15,320
personnel annually trained in

575
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:18,409
specialized courses households directly

576
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,700
reached by public extension again that's

577
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:20,539
a fairly standard measure but an

578
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,519
important one

579
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:24,980
households reached by all extension

580
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:27,289
whether it's from the public sector or

581
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:30,080
from the private sector or from civil

582
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:32,659
society organizations the quality of

583
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,919
public extension the share of households

584
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:36,559
for instance reporting the public

585
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,139
extension services were at least

586
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,409
somewhat useful on a Likert scale kind

587
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:44,539
of measure or service to female farmers

588
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:46,789
the share of females in small holder

589
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:49,909
households reporting that they received

590
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:53,289
extension services or inclusivity that

591
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:55,909
is something like maybe an index of

592
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:59,419
inclusivity of extension services

593
00:24:55,909 --> 00:25:03,440
relative to some defined disenfranchised

594
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:05,090
or underserved population so these are

595
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,440
probably some of the metrics that we

596
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,240
should be considering and I and I would

597
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,340
argue they're a great starting point for

598
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,620
this kind of initiative and on that note

599
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,899
let me just wind up my remarks simply by

600
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,929
encouraging everyone to think about the

601
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:20,179
feasibility relevance and influence of

602
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:23,149
these kind of metrics in their own

603
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:25,760
context be it their own country context

604
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:28,039
the agroecology that are concerned about

605
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,230
the farming systems that they that they

606
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:32,360
observe the provinces or states they

607
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,330
work in or the value chains and

608
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:38,090
commodities that they focus on and with

609
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:45,309
that let me hand it off to Judy Dane

610
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:48,769
thank you very much thank you Davis um I

611
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:53,529
assumed the handlers of Agri links will

612
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:57,260
let me know if I'm not being heard well

613
00:25:53,529 --> 00:26:00,399
unlike Kristin and David I do not have a

614
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:03,169
research background and the academic

615
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:07,210
discipline and clear experience that

616
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:07,210
they have pardon

617
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:12,809
I come from I came from the US private

618
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:16,320
sector and then spent about a decade at

619
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:18,899
US aid and have at least as strong as

620
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,789
interest as as Kristen and David and the

621
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:23,340
others on the small task force we put

622
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:26,279
together on figuring out better metrics

623
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:30,840
for extension I'm especially interested

624
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:32,340
in cost-effectiveness of extension

625
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,950
I've given I've worked for government

626
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:39,269
and of course are insured by government

627
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:43,259
and also the impact of extension on the

628
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:46,139
poor especially I focus on digitally

629
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:48,989
enabled extension and visually enabled

630
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:52,009
extension providers and users often

631
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:54,539
assume impact and cost effectiveness

632
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:57,679
when that's not the case or it certainly

633
00:26:54,539 --> 00:27:00,239
shouldn't be assumed it may be other

634
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:04,609
proven techniques are better so I think

635
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:07,379
these metrics will help us get at that

636
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:10,710
I'm just going to pose a few questions

637
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:13,950
and hope that they'll provoke thoughts

638
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:15,690
from the audience and participation and

639
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:18,840
additional questions from you

640
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:21,080
I wanted to point out that this is we're

641
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,179
presenting this as a point in time it's

642
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,340
definitely a work in progress the

643
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:29,039
informal task force of a handful of

644
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:31,440
people is working towards the convening

645
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:36,840
that Kristen mentioned that we hope to

646
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:40,350
have in early 2019 but we wanted to open

647
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:43,649
up the discussion to more people to get

648
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:46,649
feedback we know the metrics we have and

649
00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:49,710
the work that we're doing is not is not

650
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:56,249
as good as it can get and we hope to get

651
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:59,159
it much better before 2019 so please

652
00:27:56,249 --> 00:28:00,989
study these slides and give us feedback

653
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:04,559
during the discussion but also

654
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:05,879
afterwards you can contact any of us and

655
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,609
also our colleagues at the Gates

656
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:11,039
Foundation and the World Bank as well so

657
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:15,989
I'll pose a couple of questions just to

658
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:17,820
get the thinking going a thing that

659
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:21,059
asked about whether this would influence

660
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,880
decision-making and there is a concern

661
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:23,400
that we

662
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,860
try to set this up in some way for

663
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:32,800
governments to compete but I desert that

664
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:36,400
if we can find some agreed-upon metrics

665
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,650
and even one country or two can stand up

666
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,200
and say I'm willing to be measured

667
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:45,280
against that and show that they've made

668
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,800
progress I think that alone would be a

669
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,520
great success and then other countries

670
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,530
might follow again it's not like they're

671
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,510
doing business indicators but it still

672
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,760
would be I think a point of pride for

673
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:00,730
governments that are really struggling

674
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:06,190
and working on improving their extension

675
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:08,710
services so I think for decisions

676
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:11,140
policymaking it could have an effect

677
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,180
that we do know and we want governments

678
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,210
that are working on extension to

679
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:21,000
participate in this convening to see

680
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:23,410
whether they find these measures useful

681
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,860
Kristen also pointed out that we're

682
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:30,490
looking at fresh aspirational measures

683
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:32,080
right now hold on just a minute I want

684
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,990
to just to make sure everything's going

685
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:39,760
okay I will get out of full screen just

686
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:46,790
to make sure okay I think we're just

687
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:49,850
fine so

688
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:51,830
the rational versus actually indicators

689
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:55,160
that we can use now David actually

690
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:58,360
pointed out the many challenges to have

691
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:03,800
metrics that we can collect for overtime

692
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:07,940
all those things are are certainly true

693
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:10,910
I'd say we still need to define things

694
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:13,730
as aspirational and then see how close

695
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:19,100
we can get with at least a few measures

696
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:21,250
to start out I'd be interested if you

697
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:24,920
think that we have forgotten any

698
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:26,660
critical measures here I'll go on to my

699
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:30,230
next slide we're have additional

700
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:32,930
questions or we are have we gotten

701
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:38,810
carried away I think one danger is that

702
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:41,810
we'll forget that most public extension

703
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:44,180
services are directed to help farmers

704
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,400
but especially poor farmers and do we

705
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:49,310
have enough indicators to balance that

706
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:52,160
interest or will we be applauding

707
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:55,100
extension services that go after the

708
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,740
most able farmers and are not rewarded

709
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:02,350
for doing the harder work sometimes of

710
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:04,970
making sure the more remote farmers the

711
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:10,910
remote households can benefit from

712
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:13,540
extension services before our convening

713
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:18,430
we want to make sure we've done homework

714
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:21,410
by talking with others in a broader

715
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:23,360
context and maybe you have ideas of

716
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:25,160
organizations you want to make sure we

717
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:30,740
talk with and it may be your

718
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:33,220
organization and how well will this be

719
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:36,590
accepted or we be useful by

720
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,960
agribusinesses say or or public or

721
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:43,460
private extension service providers are

722
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:48,110
these measures irrelevant can additional

723
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:54,250
ones be added is there metric some how

724
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:56,350
to tackle how well the public extend

725
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:59,710
service is leveraging private service

726
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:02,610
providers that's another really tough

727
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:05,380
one so there's there's lots of questions

728
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:08,260
again this is a starting point so we

729
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,060
look forward to a rich discussion I'm

730
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,970
honored that I get to be the sort of

731
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,440
provocateur on this and I'm very pleased

732
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,740
that we have people like Kristin and

733
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,140
David with such experience to keep us

734
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:22,030
self keep as disciplined as we go

735
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,830
through this effort so I think I'll turn

736
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:28,180
this over to Jimmy now who can figure

737
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:30,640
out what questions you all have great

738
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,480
thank you so much Judy and thanks also

739
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,360
to your dogs Waldo for his patience and

740
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:40,300
waiting for you to present if we've had

741
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:44,380
some fun side discussion about hearing

742
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:45,790
him a little bit but so there are a lot

743
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,010
of questions and comments coming in the

744
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,810
chat box which is wonderful so we'll go

745
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,700
back and start with some of the

746
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:54,460
questions that came in a bit earlier I

747
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,800
also wanted to reassure everyone that we

748
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:59,980
will be sharing the chatbox content with

749
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,390
the presenters so any comments you type

750
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,460
in that are answering some of the

751
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:06,130
provocative questions that judy has

752
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,170
asked your answers to those and your

753
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,250
commentary will go to the presenters and

754
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,040
the Judy mentioned there's also

755
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:16,380
opportunity to think about these and

756
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,380
provide commentary after this webinar

757
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:25,260
all right so looking back to some of the

758
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:29,980
earlier questions that came in let's see

759
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:31,530
all right Kristin or David perhaps I can

760
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,510
toss this one to Kristin to start

761
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:37,630
Viviani or Viviana Palmieri

762
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:40,090
asked is there any reason why the system

763
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:41,890
is limited to extension instead of

764
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:44,110
considering the broader innovation

765
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:49,270
systems or what other related systems

766
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:55,720
oh thanks okay go for it David I can I

767
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:56,740
can take that one viviana thank you very

768
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,049
much for the question

769
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,660
certainly measuring attributes of the

770
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:03,429
wider innovation system which includes

771
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,740
research and education business and

772
00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:08,109
enterprise and the general enabling

773
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,260
environment the role of cooperatives and

774
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:14,200
extension among many other things is

775
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:17,200
important extension is just one element

776
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:20,230
in a larger agricultural innovation

777
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,179
system and we acknowledge that I think

778
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,669
what we're trying to achieve here is

779
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:27,510
simply putting some very small

780
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:30,010
boundaries around what we can measure

781
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:32,139
and hoping that contributes to broader

782
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:34,270
measurement of the innovation system so

783
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:37,109
for instance in AG innovation systems we

784
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:40,840
do measure agricultural R&D through

785
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:44,230
initiatives like Asti we also look at

786
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:46,810
you know measurements around educational

787
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:49,840
achievement and and performance systems

788
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:53,859
and whatnot through forum and others and

789
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:56,409
so on and so forth the task of measuring

790
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:58,600
every little aspect of an innovation

791
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:00,400
system is very very broad and very very

792
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,780
challenging that's why in this

793
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,430
particular exercise we're trying to

794
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,530
parse it out to something that's

795
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,570
directly relevant to sort of the the

796
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:09,760
investments and the the choices and

797
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:12,130
decisions that governments and their

798
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,560
development partners make to help them

799
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,430
inform that process that decision-making

800
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:21,760
process

801
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:23,590
thank you Kristin there are two

802
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,570
questions that came in from Mahesh

803
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,260
shondor during your presentation and so

804
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,109
I thought I'd ask

805
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:32,290
them both to you since they're sort of

806
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:34,359
short questions one was can we use the

807
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:37,320
same metrics for different extension

808
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:40,660
service providers and the other was

809
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,640
asking about measuring productivity

810
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,160
profitability

811
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,700
yes thanks very much Mahesh for joining

812
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,380
us from India can the same metrics be

813
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,180
used for different service providers

814
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,829
that very much depends on

815
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,680
the goal or the outcome pillars that

816
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:59,599
we're looking for so some providers

817
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,390
might be looking more for public goods

818
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,180
outcomes like food security and and

819
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:07,250
increasing incomes and others you know

820
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,660
might be looking for different goals and

821
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:13,099
outcomes so it's going to really depend

822
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:14,930
on your your goal and your pillar but we

823
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:16,700
are trying to make a modular approach

824
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:20,329
where you can sort of pick and choose

825
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:22,970
what what outcomes or indicators are

826
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:25,670
going to work for you and it's I'm

827
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:27,049
getting into Steve Fran's ELLs question

828
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:29,299
a little bit but we'll address that

829
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:31,549
later with regard to looking at the

830
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:35,180
overall matrix that we've come up with

831
00:36:31,549 --> 00:36:37,579
you also asked about productivity versus

832
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:40,609
profitability and we actually had that

833
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:42,980
debate within the taskforce we started

834
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:44,960
off with productivity and then we said

835
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,569
but that's not the ultimate goal the

836
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,000
ultimate goal is maybe to improve

837
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:52,760
livelihoods or increase incomes or

838
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,579
something like that and so we do have an

839
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,230
element of productivity we might expand

840
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:59,599
that and you know it's not just crop

841
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:02,480
productivity there can also be factor

842
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,190
productivity issues as well but we do

843
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,470
include the element of profitability

844
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:09,369
because that's a step beyond the

845
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:09,369
productivity

846
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:23,940
excellent thank you all right let's jump

847
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,560
up to well you mentioned that Stephen

848
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,350
had asked a question so perhaps Kristen

849
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,990
we can jump to his question and Steve

850
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:33,360
asked how are the ten listed metrics

851
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:35,880
linked to the overall objectives goals

852
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:48,660
or desired impacts of extension that

853
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:51,600
would help us see gaps and overlap yeah

854
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:54,120
thanks Steve and Judy and David feel

855
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:57,330
free to chime in after I've said my bit

856
00:37:54,120 --> 00:38:01,260
we do have a rather complex looking

857
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:04,650
matrix that has your your domains down

858
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,690
the left side and then the audience

859
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,370
across the right the pillars across the

860
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,620
right and then we've put in those

861
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:13,200
initial on Bill and Melinda Gates

862
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:15,570
Foundation indicators as well as some

863
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,000
others that we've been looking at in

864
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,160
exactly to do that to see where are the

865
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,110
gaps and what we have seen is that there

866
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:28,200
are a number of gaps in outcome pillars

867
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:29,850
like sustainability and equity so those

868
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,070
are things that we're working on it's it

869
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:35,880
was really I think too tough to show to

870
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:37,680
a webinar type of audience but hopefully

871
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,420
we're going to have something out of the

872
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,550
task force in the coming months that we

873
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:51,340
can share publicly and you can see more

874
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:53,830
clearly how it goes this is Judy

875
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:56,140
echo what Kristen said we we were

876
00:38:53,830 --> 00:39:01,450
limited to what we could present but the

877
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:04,000
matrix that Kristen refers to is is very

878
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:07,240
useful for taking a look at what we're

879
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,660
missing and the question of equity is

880
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,560
one where were where we need to think

881
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,590
much further

882
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:17,110
I think once we work a little bit more

883
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:20,770
we'll get that matrix in some form may

884
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:26,920
be multiple matrixes out there for more

885
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:28,630
review great thank you both

886
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,420
David I'll ask a couple of questions

887
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:35,530
that came in during your presentation

888
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:37,300
first up from Reginald to sense based on

889
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,640
your experience what is the minimum

890
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:43,900
timeframe to measure the impact of an

891
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:47,830
extension system alright that's it

892
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:50,050
that's a tricky question obviously if

893
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:53,560
you're trying to measure let's say the

894
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:56,980
impact of a large extension system

895
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:59,500
reform process right changing salaries

896
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,990
and incentives you know providing more

897
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:04,360
different infrastructure creating you

898
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:06,550
know new administrative routines and

899
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:09,490
procedures new leadership things like

900
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:13,360
that you know the IMP the the the time

901
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:15,430
frame may be anywhere from what two two

902
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,500
to five years five to ten years it's

903
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:19,000
very hard to say depending on it depends

904
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,090
on what outcome indicators you care

905
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,410
about things like profitability

906
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:25,810
productivity incomes and welfare

907
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:29,350
obviously take take some time to

908
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:32,590
manifest but in other in other instances

909
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:36,160
for instance you can measure the impact

910
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:38,290
of a very simple extension intervention

911
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,950
in a single season so I'll give you two

912
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:43,870
examples that we've worked on under

913
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:46,390
under the development local extension

914
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:49,960
capacity project funded by see the

915
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:52,270
future in US aid in Ethiopia working

916
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,870
with digital green and the government of

917
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:59,200
Ethiopia we examine the impact of a

918
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:03,310
video video enabled extension approach

919
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,750
on on farmers adoption of new crop

920
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:08,349
management practices

921
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:11,170
for the main cereal crops and we found

922
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:13,390
that after one season simply engaging

923
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:15,760
farmers in sort of you know video

924
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:20,940
screenings on new technologies and

925
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:25,090
practices that we saw increases in

926
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:27,070
adoption levels by five to eight

927
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:32,080
percentage points which are translated

928
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:33,730
into a much larger adoption rate on the

929
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:38,349
order of you know fifteen to twenty

930
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:39,820
percent against the the consuming of the

931
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:42,160
the control or what people were

932
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:44,410
otherwise doing in other words we saw

933
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,109
significant increases in adoption of new

934
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:49,240
technologies after one season simply by

935
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:51,130
the video extension approach in Uganda

936
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,180
we saw much of the same thing and after

937
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:58,000
one season we were focusing on maize and

938
00:41:54,180 --> 00:42:00,940
the use of video enabled a video based

939
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,400
extension approaches we actually saw

940
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:07,090
increases not only an adoption but also

941
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,710
in yield maize yields based on what

942
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:10,119
people learned in the videos of how best

943
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:12,700
management practices recommended

944
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:14,650
management practices so if it's a simple

945
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,030
like ICT based intervention you can you

946
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,920
can measure a lot of impacts in one

947
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:21,180
season if it's a structural reform

948
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,180
process well that's a lot longer

949
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:34,529
great David and allow me to throw one

950
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:35,730
more out to you you would discuss you

951
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:39,539
know the difficulty of measuring

952
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:41,339
ultimate impacts I think my house gender

953
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:43,529
added another kind of layer to that

954
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:45,749
difficulty which is that impact is an

955
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:48,480
outcome of multiple factors so how to

956
00:42:45,749 --> 00:42:50,190
isolate the impact due to extension or

957
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,220
should we even try what do you think

958
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:55,289
about that well like in the examples I

959
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,910
just gave from Ethiopia and Uganda as

960
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:58,920
well as work that other colleagues of

961
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:01,680
mine have done in India Aroo and many

962
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:05,609
other countries I I think with a

963
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:09,559
well-designed evaluation strategy you

964
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:15,630
can definitely measure the impact of

965
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:18,660
very specific extension interventions to

966
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:22,049
give you the example of what one of my

967
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:25,680
colleagues didn't Peru he he looked at

968
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:28,769
what they looked at the the impact of

969
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,640
providing agronomic recommendations to

970
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:34,230
children in high schools and trying to

971
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,989
measure whether that affected what their

972
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:38,759
parents did back on the farm and in fact

973
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,829
they found significant effects of this

974
00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:42,809
sort of intergenerational transfer of

975
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:44,970
information that's pretty exciting right

976
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:47,759
you know give extension messages in a

977
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:51,630
school and and lo and behold the parents

978
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:56,099
actually adopt you know new practices on

979
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:59,730
the farm so so you can certainly measure

980
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:01,019
some of these things the question is you

981
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,670
know how what are you trying to measure

982
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:04,529
how broad are you trying to measure with

983
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:07,529
good evaluation design you can measure a

984
00:44:04,529 --> 00:44:10,279
lot of things but like I said earlier if

985
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:12,569
we're talking about systemic reforms you

986
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:15,109
probably need a lot more data to be able

987
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:17,609
to you know control for or account for

988
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:20,519
confounding influences like changes in

989
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:23,339
the in the political winds or changes in

990
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:25,859
you know the weather over time things

991
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:29,309
like that or changes in market forces

992
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:31,319
and prices as long as you can count for

993
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:33,090
those kind of factors there is

994
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:36,300
possibility to to

995
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:38,100
to suss out the impact of extension its

996
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:41,460
but it can be challenging both in terms

997
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:44,130
of data and and sort of quality of

998
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,900
inquiry so you know your evaluation

999
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:47,670
strategy really matters but we do it all

1000
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,290
the time we love to do it and it's

1001
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:54,480
something that we would love to explore

1002
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:56,340
with many of our partners great thank

1003
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,020
you David and thank you to all of our

1004
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,150
participants who are putting some really

1005
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:11,940
excellent questions and comments in the

1006
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:15,920
chat box all right so there were a

1007
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:18,990
couple of questions that came in about

1008
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,810
private service providers and so I'll

1009
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,860
ask them both and we can perhaps answer

1010
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:26,370
them in combination

1011
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:28,080
so Padma Singh asked about the

1012
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:30,180
presenters thoughts on considering

1013
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,700
service providers and angry

1014
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:35,240
entrepreneurs as a target audience of

1015
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:40,440
Agriculture X Agricultural Extension and

1016
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:43,320
then the Catherine Killaloe wanted to

1017
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:45,390
know about how does the private sector

1018
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:48,360
compare in terms of cost effectiveness

1019
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:54,270
of delivery and understanding those

1020
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:57,990
business cases yes o process.i

1021
00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:00,110
conservative Judy first okay well I

1022
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:02,550
think I would distinguish between

1023
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:05,450
third-party service providers that are

1024
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:08,180
providing digitally enabled extension

1025
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:11,790
ones that would be providing it for

1026
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:14,910
private agribusinesses as well as for

1027
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:17,670
public extension service providers say

1028
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:21,630
digital green does this so they would be

1029
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:24,480
I would I would assume severally these

1030
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:26,790
metrics would be relevant for them to be

1031
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,550
able to prove that their services are

1032
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:31,770
are worth paying for by the public

1033
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:34,170
sector or an agribusiness so that would

1034
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:37,170
be I think many of the made metrics

1035
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:41,790
apply directly another category of

1036
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:45,339
private sector folks in extension are

1037
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:50,140
those that are say sectoral associate

1038
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:53,650
Asians for coffee or cocoa these are

1039
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:58,979
very large plantation operators for

1040
00:46:53,650 --> 00:47:02,920
pineapple or other large export crops a

1041
00:46:58,979 --> 00:47:06,069
very short list of metrics might be

1042
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:08,499
relevant if they get public funds they

1043
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:12,670
would care about the ones related to

1044
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:15,519
equity but I'd love to hear candidates

1045
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:17,229
who might be able to tell us whether

1046
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:19,719
these are relevant or not you can just

1047
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:23,289
actually let us know in the chat window

1048
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:25,359
and we can later follow up so Kristin

1049
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:27,539
and David probably have some comments as

1050
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,539
well

1051
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:48,599
all right if Kristin or David would like

1052
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:50,550
to chime in on those so you feel free so

1053
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:54,920
many good ones I'm I'm just doing my

1054
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:58,260
best to sort through them all let's see

1055
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:01,410
all right for Kristin

1056
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:03,450
Marissa sternness asked are there

1057
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:05,940
targets or guidelines for any of these

1058
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:07,500
metrics once you get the data how would

1059
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,410
you know if you're doing well for

1060
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,540
example if they're I recommend oh thanks

1061
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:14,940
or it's a very very good question and

1062
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:17,670
that's an important one as well

1063
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,500
it does depend on the indicator so the

1064
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:22,890
fao for instance has some

1065
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:25,589
recommendations of minimum budgets that

1066
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:27,720
should be spent on extension services or

1067
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:30,750
minimum number of extension agent to

1068
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,670
Farmer ratio things like that but in in

1069
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,980
general I think a lot of the things

1070
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:38,040
there is going to be no no

1071
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:40,109
recommendation perhaps at national level

1072
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:42,839
maybe the organization implementing it

1073
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:45,510
might have their own targets and so

1074
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:47,910
forth interestingly I was on a webinar

1075
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:50,549
yesterday with the UNDP

1076
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:53,640
Green commodities program and they are

1077
00:48:50,549 --> 00:48:56,369
trying to set up a comparable sort of

1078
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,930
way to diagnose extension systems that

1079
00:48:56,369 --> 00:49:00,420
would start with a baseline and give

1080
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:04,440
scores over the years so there are some

1081
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:05,819
related initiatives going on but David

1082
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,720
or Judy I'm not sure if you want to add

1083
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:16,380
anything to that

1084
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:18,780
I can I can say I guess one thing I

1085
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,549
think you know you can use metrics in so

1086
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:24,000
many ways cross country comparability

1087
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:26,819
for instance gives you the you know a

1088
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,589
chance to see what those countries that

1089
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:30,480
you like to compare yourself to are

1090
00:49:28,589 --> 00:49:32,880
doing and think of that in an

1091
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,430
aspirational sensing okay China does

1092
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,319
this we want to be like that or Ethiopia

1093
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:39,299
does this we want to be like that for

1094
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:41,520
instance but I think more importantly

1095
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:43,500
for any given country a program these

1096
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,080
types of indicators are simply good

1097
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,930
to benchmark oh you know changes over

1098
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:52,890
time and look at you know what types of

1099
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:54,480
investments what type of personnel what

1100
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:57,660
type of resources are being channeled

1101
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,610
into extension and you know over the

1102
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,620
years and is it improving or is it not

1103
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:03,800
improving I mean and whether you know

1104
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:09,300
people perceive quality changes in

1105
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:10,980
relevance and usefulness of extension so

1106
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,200
you can use it in so many different ways

1107
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:16,070
I guess I guess you know like I was

1108
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,720
saying earlier in my presentation part

1109
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:20,520
what you probably don't want to do is

1110
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,230
though is get into this you know sort of

1111
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,240
competitive you know race to the top

1112
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:25,980
race to the bottom because sometimes you

1113
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,750
know the context is so specific that

1114
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,760
it's you know one country is trying to

1115
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:31,380
get to where another country is but the

1116
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,180
systems are really different or the

1117
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,490
challenges are really different you know

1118
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:37,760
does that serve anybody's purpose or

1119
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:40,470
policymakers try to game the system by

1120
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,630
throwing money at extension without

1121
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:45,390
thinking about you know quality or

1122
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:46,830
administration or or incentives and

1123
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:51,680
things like that does that really help

1124
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:54,270
things so there are you know using using

1125
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,370
extension indicators in different ways

1126
00:50:54,270 --> 00:51:04,590
is good using them cautiously is even

1127
00:50:56,370 --> 00:51:08,550
better this is Judy I have one related

1128
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:11,880
comment actually it sort of veers us off

1129
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:14,460
set the topic of goals although I think

1130
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,290
that's a great question and that will

1131
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:18,630
certainly depend on the comments of

1132
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:21,090
Kristin David made I was thinking I've

1133
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:24,060
read quite a bit about one acre fund

1134
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:25,920
lately and it provides extension

1135
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:29,880
services it provides financing it

1136
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,320
provides input it provides a package of

1137
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,620
things it doesn't worry about

1138
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:36,720
distinguishing what its extension type

1139
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:40,700
services are doing versus its other

1140
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:44,700
services it's focused primarily on

1141
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:48,960
scaling and outcome so that it's sort of

1142
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:51,930
a counterpoint to that the for middle

1143
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:56,710
effort we're talking about here and in a

1144
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:58,599
way it makes it easier for many

1145
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:01,990
organizations that might somewhat like

1146
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:04,750
that to look for results

1147
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:07,210
so maybe the third-party service

1148
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:09,400
providers could keep that in mind and

1149
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:11,589
give us comments on whether any of this

1150
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:23,020
is even relevant if you've got some

1151
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:24,790
focused goals of your own questions that

1152
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:27,940
are really related I think to what you

1153
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:30,609
were all just discussing about adapting

1154
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:35,530
the content of the framework near and

1155
00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:37,660
jakka Rama Stan javo asked do we want a

1156
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:39,640
measurement that is comparable globally

1157
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,540
or something that is specific to the

1158
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:45,010
needs and context of each country and

1159
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:46,990
Marisa our new staffs are really good

1160
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:49,000
question saying that these indicators

1161
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:50,619
are geared towards governments or

1162
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,380
measuring at a higher administration

1163
00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:58,230
level can they be adapted to community

1164
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:58,230
level interventions from NGOs and how

1165
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:06,310
well good questions no simple answers

1166
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:11,380
I'm sure Kristin and David could chime

1167
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:15,700
in as well if we get good measures

1168
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:17,950
defined they certainly can be used at a

1169
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:21,270
sub-national level between communities

1170
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:23,740
and with civil society organizations

1171
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:26,349
they'll just have to pick and choose and

1172
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:29,050
figure out practical ways that they can

1173
00:53:26,349 --> 00:53:32,080
use them you know clearly they won't be

1174
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:35,440
able to do as a rigorous of data

1175
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:37,180
collection as would be possible without

1176
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,490
an international organization like if

1177
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:46,540
pre coming from the private sector I

1178
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:50,380
tend to have a more practical outlook on

1179
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:54,060
it being some is better than nothing at

1180
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:57,730
all and if we have metrics that we've

1181
00:53:54,060 --> 00:54:01,480
together defines then all the better

1182
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:03,310
so try to get try to use define metrics

1183
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,050
and then figure out how well though you

1184
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:06,930
are they'll work for you for your

1185
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:09,610
organization your community

1186
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:15,580
Kristin David do you have more

1187
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:16,960
thoughtful comments I guess I guess just

1188
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:19,950
to say that you know international

1189
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:24,340
comparability has its pros and cons and

1190
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:27,660
it can be useful for for instance for

1191
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:30,190
international development partners

1192
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:32,290
multilateral and bilateral donor

1193
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:34,060
agencies in making investment choices

1194
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:35,710
and decisions that's why the Gates

1195
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:37,810
Foundation developed their bash their

1196
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:40,720
dashboard after all that's why I'm sure

1197
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:43,090
Feed the Future USA and many others care

1198
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,490
about these these sort of international

1199
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:49,090
comparability --zz that we're talking

1200
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:51,670
about but of course at a government or

1201
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:53,110
country level and that a look at an

1202
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:56,800
organizational level they're also

1203
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:59,350
important some degree of standardization

1204
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,030
is helpful because again you can use a

1205
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:03,430
baseline and benchmark and compare

1206
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:06,850
whether it's between organizations or

1207
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:09,220
states or countries or or whatever you

1208
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:10,930
choose I think that's the key to

1209
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,240
indicators well you know commonly

1210
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:16,950
accepted indicators make life I think a

1211
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:18,910
lot more useful or a lot a lot easier

1212
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:33,690
then everybody choosing your own

1213
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:36,580
indicators from Thomas Caffrey Osvald

1214
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:38,470
how can the impact of extension services

1215
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,450
be effectively measured when one farmer

1216
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:43,150
may be receiving overlapping extension

1217
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:44,980
support for example from public

1218
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:46,780
Extension Service as well as from

1219
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:50,430
private sector when coupled with

1220
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:53,410
investment in new technology or input

1221
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:55,630
that's a great question again it goes

1222
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:58,240
back to the response again to Mahesh

1223
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:59,950
earlier you know it depends on your

1224
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:04,420
evaluation design and what you're trying

1225
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:06,340
to measure so you know those are simply

1226
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:09,610
questions you can ask well we regularly

1227
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:12,370
ask them in in household farm household

1228
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:13,390
surveys where we ask people farmers

1229
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,790
where you know where do they get

1230
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:19,480
information from about you know crop

1231
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:21,610
acts or technology why and and we allow

1232
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,270
for multiple responses might come from

1233
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:25,940
public extension or

1234
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:27,980
private extension sources or might be

1235
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:29,450
some combination of both now you know

1236
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:33,110
I've been in the field where a public

1237
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:35,360
extension agent is working with it was a

1238
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:38,510
corporate sales agent at the same time

1239
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:42,170
to promote a new a new cultivar a new

1240
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:43,850
hybrid a new you know a new machine or

1241
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:45,350
something like that so yeah people work

1242
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:48,820
in tandem people working in

1243
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:52,010
collaborative ways I think that's

1244
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:53,990
perfectly fine and and you know as long

1245
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:57,440
as you're able to account for that and

1246
00:56:53,990 --> 00:57:00,440
have that information then you know you

1247
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:03,020
can you can parse out you can parse out

1248
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,460
the effects I mean you know sometimes

1249
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:07,820
there's an art to this sometimes there's

1250
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:10,390
a science to it it really depends on

1251
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:13,220
what the intention of your evaluation is

1252
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:18,940
if you're trying to say okay you know my

1253
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:21,860
NGO did this and the government didn't

1254
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:24,650
then then you know that's a fairly I

1255
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:26,030
think narrow assessment approach or

1256
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:28,730
evaluation approach if you're trying to

1257
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:30,560
say well you know information from you

1258
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:32,660
know these types of sources led to the

1259
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:34,880
outcomes we care about then that might

1260
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:36,770
be I think a more realistic way of

1261
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,540
approaching the problem or the question

1262
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:39,890
it really ultimately depends on what

1263
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:44,350
your learning objectives and what your

1264
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:44,350
evaluation objectives are in this case

1265
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:56,280
great thank you David

1266
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:59,130
all right let's see curtain I will show

1267
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,740
a question to you from Vicki Sigmund is

1268
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:05,640
the expectation that public sector

1269
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:08,100
Extension will support ie pay for data

1270
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:10,440
collection or otherwise what role will

1271
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:12,240
they play if the public sector is to

1272
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,970
support this then are there clear

1273
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,970
indications or if I guess if the public

1274
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:19,500
so there are there clear indication

1275
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:22,800
thanks hi Vicki thanks for your

1276
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:24,600
excellent question there is some

1277
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,060
expectation that there will be interest

1278
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,130
on the side of governments and actually

1279
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:32,040
this is part of the role of the task

1280
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:34,350
force now and the next few months is to

1281
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,420
go and to start to talk to potential

1282
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:39,210
governments that we think would be

1283
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:40,650
interested and to see are they

1284
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:42,420
interested in collecting extension

1285
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:45,570
metrics and then invite them to the

1286
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:47,130
convening in Uganda in February and sit

1287
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:50,340
down and hash through it a little bit

1288
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:52,170
more so how it's gonna be done is is yet

1289
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,910
to be seen it might be different in

1290
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:55,740
every country but there is the

1291
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:58,740
expectation but there's going to be

1292
00:58:55,740 --> 00:59:01,170
funding whether it's coming from a sort

1293
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:05,010
of an outside donor or governments in

1294
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:06,870
terms of using these data to inform and

1295
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:11,480
advocate for their policies for

1296
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:11,480
extension that's that remains to be seen

1297
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:24,490
Thank You Kristen and we still have some

1298
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:27,490
good time for questions but I just

1299
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:29,220
wanted to flag a few upcoming events and

1300
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:32,380
activities on a burling's

1301
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:34,599
first to feed the future learning agenda

1302
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:37,030
the draft agenda for phase 2 FC the

1303
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:40,300
future is currently open for public

1304
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:41,980
comment and you can see the dress

1305
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:44,369
learning agenda and a survey link for

1306
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:47,680
commenting there next to number one

1307
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:49,540
number two if you are a student or you

1308
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,670
know one who is working in the food

1309
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,830
security and agriculture space Agri

1310
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:56,710
links is currently having a young

1311
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:58,330
scholars blog contest but which students

1312
00:59:56,710 --> 01:00:00,640
can submit their blog post about their

1313
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:03,520
work or their insights on global food

1314
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:07,560
security and we're going to pick with a

1315
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:09,609
panel of US aid and Agri links

1316
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,470
individuals we're going to pick the top

1317
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:13,540
blog post to published and feature on

1318
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:15,570
Agri links so do encourage your student

1319
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:18,910
students in your life to apply and

1320
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:20,500
lastly we wanted to announce the October

1321
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:23,080
theme month for every links right now

1322
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:25,270
we're in extension month clearly but

1323
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:27,820
next month is going to be value-added

1324
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:30,640
food month which I'm really excited to

1325
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:33,160
to talk about we'll probably be having a

1326
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:35,109
webinar on orange flash super to potato

1327
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,330
and been talking about all of the

1328
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:40,240
entrepreneurial ways that farmers

1329
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:42,190
processors other actors can add value to

1330
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:45,010
food for better incomes and better

1331
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:47,980
nutrition so keep all of those in mind

1332
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:50,290
oh and I also wanted to point out in the

1333
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:52,839
links box to your left you'll see a link

1334
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:54,460
for the del X community of practice we

1335
01:00:52,839 --> 01:00:56,050
definitely encourage everyone on this

1336
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:58,780
webinar to join that community of

1337
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,700
practice the there will be a lot of

1338
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:03,609
additional ways to discuss these topics

1339
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:04,990
through that website and through some

1340
01:01:03,609 --> 01:01:07,690
webinar and other discussion

1341
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:12,910
opportunities that Dee lek presents so

1342
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:16,869
don't hesitate to join that COP alright

1343
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:19,690
so back to oh we've got a bit of an a

1344
01:01:16,869 --> 01:01:21,490
large none of that links box we'll go

1345
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:23,140
ahead and bring the head back dad so

1346
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:26,080
that was just really telling you all to

1347
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:27,290
click on those links excellent okay so

1348
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:31,099
back

1349
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:34,369
the questions that have come in okay I

1350
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:38,510
will go to a question that came in from

1351
01:01:34,369 --> 01:01:41,000
Kathy Perry in the ten common metrics

1352
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:43,010
the quality of public extension is a

1353
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,869
metric but the same approach of

1354
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:47,390
determining quality is not applied to

1355
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:49,730
the private sector is it implicitly

1356
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:51,680
implied that private sector extension

1357
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:54,770
does not need to be assessed for quality

1358
01:01:51,680 --> 01:02:02,450
of extension and Judy was that one that

1359
01:01:54,770 --> 01:02:04,160
you could address sure I'll start how

1360
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:06,530
many come from the private sector and

1361
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:11,720
the private sector cares a lot about

1362
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:14,540
success and it defines what did success

1363
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:17,119
means if it's getting donor money of

1364
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:19,640
course it cares a lot what donors care

1365
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:24,950
about but say a private company that

1366
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:27,650
owns pineapple plantation cares a lot

1367
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:32,150
about productivity it cares a lot about

1368
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:36,530
making sure its workers stick to them

1369
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:40,540
and we hope are treated well but we

1370
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:43,099
can't these metrics will be decided by

1371
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:45,530
so they're not by the private sector but

1372
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:48,380
maybe some of the others could chime in

1373
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:51,970
but certainly any service provider cares

1374
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:55,900
a lot about showing how effective their

1375
01:02:51,970 --> 01:03:00,770
services are so those metrics will be

1376
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:02,420
truly relevant yeah I can quickly add to

1377
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:05,180
that I'd say that we have some

1378
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:08,420
experience on on the measurement of

1379
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:10,780
agricultural research indicators to say

1380
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:14,450
what's possible what's not possible

1381
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:16,520
measuring both the levels and the the

1382
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:18,829
type of private investment in

1383
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:21,290
agricultural research for instance has

1384
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:24,470
proven to be very difficult especially

1385
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:25,510
for for initiatives like a steam which I

1386
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:29,470
mentioned earlier

1387
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:32,089
and that's largely because AG research

1388
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,440
indicators that is you know investment

1389
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:36,349
spending things like that

1390
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,690
personnel and so on our proprietary

1391
01:03:36,349 --> 01:03:40,849
information they form for many companies

1392
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:43,549
they form the basis of their competitive

1393
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:47,390
advantage in the margin you know in very

1394
01:03:43,549 --> 01:03:49,519
competitive marketplaces so think along

1395
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:52,339
the same lines our extension if you're a

1396
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:54,799
an agro service provider of some sort

1397
01:03:52,339 --> 01:03:56,930
your private your profit-making you

1398
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:58,999
don't necessarily you know want to give

1399
01:03:56,930 --> 01:04:00,859
out information on hey how many people

1400
01:03:58,999 --> 01:04:03,729
do we have on the ground providing after

1401
01:04:00,859 --> 01:04:06,950
sales support or providing you know

1402
01:04:03,729 --> 01:04:08,839
recommendations to farmers and advice on

1403
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:11,029
an ad hoc basis or you know through our

1404
01:04:08,839 --> 01:04:13,069
call center or whatever it is that might

1405
01:04:11,029 --> 01:04:14,960
be proprietary information that you know

1406
01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:19,099
that that the company wants to protect

1407
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:20,749
so that becomes very difficult to get so

1408
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:23,660
you know but that doesn't imply that

1409
01:04:20,749 --> 01:04:26,569
it's not it's not the quality of private

1410
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:29,599
extension is not an important measure as

1411
01:04:26,569 --> 01:04:30,890
Judy said you know people care about the

1412
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,079
quality of their products in the private

1413
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:35,599
sector as much if not more than they do

1414
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:36,979
in the public sector so somebody's

1415
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:39,200
measuring it it's a question of whether

1416
01:04:36,979 --> 01:04:42,729
it's going to be shared in the public

1417
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,729
domain or not thank you

1418
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:50,810
great thank you so much

1419
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:52,760
I'd like to toss it back to you David

1420
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:56,270
for a really interesting question that

1421
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:58,790
came in from the Civic Amol Yan looking

1422
01:04:56,270 --> 01:05:00,980
at the gapes metrics what if we were to

1423
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:03,950
reach 100 percent of households covered

1424
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:07,430
by extension have a very generous public

1425
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:09,560
budget service the females etc but no

1426
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:12,500
essential increase in yield for hectare

1427
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:14,210
no increase in production and trade are

1428
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,480
those the most important and probably

1429
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:19,640
the only metrics that matter

1430
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:23,150
that's a great question doc I thought

1431
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:26,540
earlier I had to laugh it's it's yes

1432
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:29,300
it's precisely what one wants to be

1433
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:31,820
asking the proof is in the pudding as

1434
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:34,190
they say if you measure something but

1435
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:39,460
you can't attribute that measurement to

1436
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:42,080
some outcome of interest then then maybe

1437
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:44,270
the problem the problem isn't your

1438
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:46,490
measurement so much as it is your theory

1439
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:48,260
of change so what you're basically

1440
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:50,900
describing here is a situation in which

1441
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:56,330
your theory of change doesn't stand up

1442
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:58,040
to - you know empirical testing and that

1443
01:05:56,330 --> 01:06:01,760
extension has no effect on these

1444
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:03,350
outcomes of interest in which case you

1445
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,330
probably have to go back to the drawing

1446
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:08,450
board and say well extension really has

1447
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:10,750
nothing to do with you know productivity

1448
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:13,040
profitability incomes welfare

1449
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:18,020
environmental sustainability and so on

1450
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:19,970
and so forth now of course whether you

1451
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:22,100
know whether that's really the case is a

1452
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:23,810
bigger question and and I think that's

1453
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:26,360
again where we go back to a good

1454
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:27,740
evaluation design and saying okay you

1455
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:30,410
know we've got some measurements on

1456
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:32,450
extension and now we want to go back and

1457
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:34,310
make sure that that we're able to say

1458
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:38,480
that you know these measurements are

1459
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:42,170
somehow correlated and potentially infer

1460
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:45,170
causality about their you know their

1461
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:46,670
their influence on on outcomes so yeah

1462
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:48,500
there's a lot of sort of you know

1463
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:50,750
hypothesis testing and all of this not

1464
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:52,250
just measurement and and that's

1465
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:56,080
something we have to be very very I

1466
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:56,080
think serious about in our work

1467
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:05,680
thank you David and I would like to

1468
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:09,010
throw out another question that came in

1469
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:10,840
from Alma do if Sokka can we use the

1470
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:13,000
same approach to measure quality

1471
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:15,210
outcomes like for instance the

1472
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,010
functionality of innovations platform

1473
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:23,680
farmers capacity to mobilize funds from

1474
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:30,400
institutions etc and that was for David

1475
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:32,140
or Kristin you can fill in the gaps yeah

1476
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,360
thanks for your question I mean I think

1477
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:37,630
this is is an approach that can be

1478
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:40,090
applied in other similar institutions I

1479
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:41,740
mean extension is quite a complex

1480
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:43,570
institution and then when you're getting

1481
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:45,520
into innovation platforms and things

1482
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:47,920
like that it includes even more

1483
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,690
variables and actors and so forth but I

1484
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,000
think the general setup of how we're

1485
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:55,060
looking at this and applying things

1486
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,120
based on those different domains as well

1487
01:07:55,060 --> 01:08:01,200
as the different outcome pillars I think

1488
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:04,090
we could try to apply it to two similar

1489
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:07,200
activities like innovation platforms and

1490
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:07,200
so forth David

1491
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:13,910
[Music]

1492
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:16,580
so there's been some interesting work on

1493
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:19,699
the measurement of the functionality of

1494
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:23,390
innovation platforms for instance by it

1495
01:08:19,699 --> 01:08:25,880
by Pam book at Wageningen University in

1496
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:30,230
the Netherlands and as well as

1497
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:31,989
colleagues so so yeah and you can

1498
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:34,130
certainly measure those types of outcome

1499
01:08:31,989 --> 01:08:36,170
you can measure things like farmer's

1500
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:38,420
capacity to mobilize funds from

1501
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:42,739
financial institutions and so on those

1502
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:47,739
are all indicators that you can even

1503
01:08:42,739 --> 01:08:53,029
look at and whether they're linked to

1504
01:08:47,739 --> 01:08:58,390
extension you're thinking the theory

1505
01:08:53,029 --> 01:09:00,830
have changed and and how you measure it

1506
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:02,029
one I would I would suggest that if

1507
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:04,910
you're really interested in these topics

1508
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:08,350
and and poking around in the data take a

1509
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:11,000
look at those at the LSMs integrated

1510
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:12,949
surveys on agriculture from the World

1511
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,020
Bank that I mentioned earlier I mean

1512
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:18,980
there's there's a incredible amount of

1513
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:21,589
information there that people are really

1514
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:24,109
digging through intensively to learn

1515
01:09:21,589 --> 01:09:27,739
more exactly the kind of questions

1516
01:09:24,109 --> 01:09:30,730
you're asking you know and and you know

1517
01:09:27,739 --> 01:09:35,270
I kind of sort of data analysis and

1518
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:36,529
approaches are are key to answering but

1519
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:39,850
they're but they're they're good ones

1520
01:09:36,529 --> 01:09:39,850
they're good ones to explore

1521
01:09:48,350 --> 01:10:01,190
Oh finally speaking alright okay

1522
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:03,790
interesting comments came in from gear

1523
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:07,880
Gary Alex that I thought that Kristin

1524
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:10,520
could address so Gary said for an

1525
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:12,080
understanding of extension systems it is

1526
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,330
probably important to start from the

1527
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:16,400
farmer level to understand the needs

1528
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:18,740
objectives preferences and potential

1529
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,570
actors too often we have gaps in the

1530
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:23,150
understanding and perspective and treat

1531
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:25,370
the farmer as a blank slate to be worked

1532
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:27,410
on it is hard to think of how this might

1533
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:30,680
be reflected in an indicator but it's

1534
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:33,320
important yes hi Gary

1535
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:35,690
my first comment is that we're going to

1536
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:37,130
try to rope you into this task force I

1537
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:39,230
don't know if John got in touch with you

1538
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:43,430
yet but we'd love your inputs on it but

1539
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:45,680
certainly for an extension program to be

1540
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:48,350
to be relevant and as you say effective

1541
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:51,860
and all of these things I mean it's got

1542
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:54,320
to be relevant and useful to the

1543
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:56,390
clientele and the extension services

1544
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:58,990
need to have that client client oriented

1545
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:58,990
approach

1546
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:04,400
so we do need to have their opinions it

1547
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:07,969
it would be interesting to look for some

1548
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:10,030
indicators to reflect that and it's of

1549
01:11:07,969 --> 01:11:12,890
course again going to depend on our

1550
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:15,770
ultimate program goals and program

1551
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:18,880
objectives so if we're trying to empower

1552
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:21,200
farmers and have a demand driven program

1553
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,440
that's certainly one that we would want

1554
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,440
to

1555
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:36,400
oh great I think David you said you had

1556
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:38,840
some additional comments

1557
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:41,360
sure so so let me see if I can tackle

1558
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:44,120
two comments one is related to what Gary

1559
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:47,120
Alex said and another one from Andrea

1560
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:50,690
borne on the importance of using data

1561
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:53,810
collected from farmers to who to provide

1562
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:56,060
feedback to farmers so so at these both

1563
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:58,610
of these comments have a similar thread

1564
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:00,290
or a similar vein which is that you know

1565
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:02,240
you know often when we think about

1566
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:03,950
metrics and indicators we're really

1567
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:05,090
we're really top down and how we think

1568
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:07,430
about things right we're thinking of

1569
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:08,990
this big system level and we want to

1570
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:11,360
measure things so we have international

1571
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:13,280
comparability and we can you know steer

1572
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,960
our investments in the right way well

1573
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,490
that's all good and fine but if we don't

1574
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,240
really understand sort of what's going

1575
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:21,620
on at the grassroots level and if we're

1576
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:24,770
not really using this type of

1577
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:26,210
information to inform people at the

1578
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:28,400
grassroots level then we're probably

1579
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:29,990
falling short of our objectives and you

1580
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,970
know I couldn't agree more I mean I

1581
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:34,010
think that's exactly the way we should

1582
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:37,400
be thinking about development processes

1583
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:39,500
development processes economic and

1584
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,480
social development do not occur on the

1585
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:45,440
basis of what we think about in

1586
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:47,600
Washington DC or Seattle or London or

1587
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:50,720
Paris or wherever they happen at the

1588
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:55,040
grassroots where people exist and the

1589
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:56,840
more we think about farmers as a diverse

1590
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:59,410
set of people that are more than just

1591
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,910
farmers the better we are at

1592
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:04,970
understanding how to tailor extension

1593
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:06,530
services to fit their needs

1594
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:08,950
one of the things we care about in

1595
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:10,910
particular when we're looking at

1596
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:13,490
indicators of you know how well is

1597
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:16,190
extension achieving the outcomes that

1598
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:19,430
were focused on is to think not at the

1599
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:20,900
average effect size or the average the

1600
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:23,060
magnitude of the average effects but

1601
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:25,220
also to parse it out and think a little

1602
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:27,620
bit about how certain subgroups are

1603
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:31,010
affected so for instance thinking about

1604
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:34,820
you know the work in Uganda Uganda has a

1605
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:38,030
inordinately large number of women

1606
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:39,980
headed households because of demographic

1607
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:43,850
pressures pressures associated not just

1608
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:44,330
with urbanization but also the hiv/aids

1609
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:46,520
and

1610
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:48,860
like that that the country has suffered

1611
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:50,840
through for decades so focusing on that

1612
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:51,410
particular sub population is really

1613
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,270
important

1614
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:55,460
women headed households are children and

1615
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:57,680
youth headed household in Uganda are a

1616
01:13:55,460 --> 01:14:00,290
significant part of the population and

1617
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:02,030
we don't think about much so focusing on

1618
01:14:00,290 --> 01:14:03,500
them getting you know getting a better

1619
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:07,130
understanding what extension does and

1620
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:10,460
doesn't do for them is a great way to to

1621
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:12,130
address these these these issues so yes

1622
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:14,930
I think starting from the bottom up and

1623
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:17,720
worrying less about not worrying less

1624
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:19,370
but but you know maintaining a balance

1625
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,600
between what we think about the

1626
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:23,060
grassroots and what we think of that

1627
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:25,400
this this much higher systems levels is

1628
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:31,580
necessary balance is everything thank

1629
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:34,900
you great very interesting answers thank

1630
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:37,850
you to both of you let's see we do have

1631
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:39,830
about up to ten more minutes for

1632
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:42,230
questions but in the meantime we wanted

1633
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:44,450
to throw up a few poll questions for all

1634
01:14:42,230 --> 01:14:47,990
of you to help us better understand your

1635
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:49,970
experience on the webinar so we'd love

1636
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:52,010
to know how likely it is that you would

1637
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:55,490
recommend this webinar to a friend or

1638
01:14:52,010 --> 01:14:57,020
colleague did anything surprise you from

1639
01:14:55,490 --> 01:15:00,140
the content of this webinar are you

1640
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:02,150
walking with any new insights what was

1641
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:06,110
not address that we could potentially

1642
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:07,280
address in the future asking about if

1643
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:09,110
you'd like to stay involved in the

1644
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,570
common metrics initiative so that we can

1645
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:13,310
continue to reach out to you and what

1646
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:15,050
was most useful to your work so please

1647
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:18,290
to let us know your answers to these

1648
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:22,400
questions they'll help us better shape

1649
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:25,310
future webinars and events all right

1650
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:27,280
let's see we've got just a few more

1651
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:30,620
questions that I think we can answer and

1652
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:33,100
a question flash comment came in from

1653
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:36,620
Suzanne Pullen's that I will toss out

1654
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:38,450
Suzanne said farming is a business how

1655
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:41,180
do business advisory services measure

1656
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:43,670
impact what metrics do these business

1657
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:45,860
advisory services use and could these be

1658
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:49,850
relevant to farming businesses and other

1659
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:53,590
agribusinesses and judy we thought

1660
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:53,590
perhaps you could start on that question

1661
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:59,370
actually I would ask Suzanne to bet

1662
01:15:57,190 --> 01:16:02,920
herself she's an expert on all of this

1663
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:06,040
so and I learned a lot from her and I

1664
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:07,090
hope to continue so I don't have any any

1665
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,710
answer that

1666
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:12,910
Suzanne probably wouldn't have herself

1667
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:14,820
clearly farming is a business it's more

1668
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:16,660
than a business it's a it's the

1669
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:21,100
household livelihood

1670
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:24,190
so measuring business services as part

1671
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:24,730
of it as part of extension is a big

1672
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:27,780
challenge

1673
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:30,370
both Kristen and David are better

1674
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:33,370
students of the definition of extension

1675
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:35,820
and we're business advisory services fit

1676
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:55,330
in so maybe they can comment on where

1677
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:58,210
what metric would tackle that all right

1678
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:59,830
and Judy let me toss another one out to

1679
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:01,930
you from Padma Singh

1680
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:04,540
how do we ensure that producers are

1681
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:06,310
getting a fair share in benefit in

1682
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:07,870
private sector extensions as the

1683
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:15,250
governor or does the government have a

1684
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:18,370
role here I say follow the money his

1685
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:20,980
government has money in those service

1686
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:24,660
services being provided or a donor does

1687
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:27,010
then yes the government has a role in

1688
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:32,970
measuring that and of course in some

1689
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:32,970
countries there are rules about how

1690
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:43,800
farmers or our service of those getting

1691
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:46,420
services ash should be served or treated

1692
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:49,330
clearly if a private company is

1693
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:53,290
providing these services on its own for

1694
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:55,840
its own gains and that of its owners

1695
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:58,270
then the government has far less of a

1696
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:59,050
role and given I came from the private

1697
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:02,410
sector I

1698
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:04,000
I certainly honor that private

1699
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:06,160
businesses ever have

1700
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,590
strong reasons to measure their own

1701
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:11,650
success they surely have to protect

1702
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:16,420
those that they serve through various

1703
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:19,180
other laws but applying these metrics by

1704
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:21,610
the government on totally private

1705
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:23,950
service providers I don't think we'd

1706
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:26,050
have to do that with great caution and

1707
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:29,110
maybe do it voluntarily so that the

1708
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:32,920
private services providers can have an

1709
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:59,620
incentive to do it to show how well they

1710
01:18:32,920 --> 01:19:01,450
serve their audience to that question I

1711
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:03,130
think there's a number of people on the

1712
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:05,950
webinar Gary and Ontario

1713
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:07,840
David and myself who have been trying to

1714
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:09,880
measure extension and you know

1715
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:13,180
struggling with with indicators and data

1716
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:16,150
and so forth so it is a trade-off I mean

1717
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:19,210
there's the data we ideally would like

1718
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:21,130
to have and we're starting from there

1719
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:22,630
and we're gonna try to get it and see

1720
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:24,910
how it works

1721
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:27,370
in the end its it might be necessary to

1722
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:29,920
come down to you know what's gonna be

1723
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:33,520
more feasible and more easy to collect

1724
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:35,470
so we're gonna we're gonna see about

1725
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,810
piloting this in one or more countries

1726
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:39,320
and and take it from there and see what

1727
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:42,430
works

1728
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,430
[Music]

1729
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:57,660
great Thank You Kristen

1730
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:59,820
and David let me look way back to your

1731
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:03,840
presentation for a question that came in

1732
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:05,820
fairly early on from Hamid or Rahman who

1733
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:08,880
said it is difficult to measure outcomes

1734
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:10,410
in terms of monetary value is there any

1735
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,090
good indicator available for the

1736
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:16,610
researchers or just a little bit more

1737
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:20,190
perspective on measuring monetary value

1738
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:22,110
it depends on which outcomes you are

1739
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:24,420
interested in monetary value can

1740
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:26,190
certainly be measured to give you to

1741
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:28,620
give you a sense we've been talking a

1742
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:32,970
lot about profitability of farming or

1743
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:35,550
farm activities so if we if we want to

1744
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:37,470
put a monetary value on that you know we

1745
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:40,770
look at we look at the costs and returns

1746
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:42,960
to to cultivation of a particular crop

1747
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:46,350
or commodity or the whole farms the

1748
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:49,380
overall profitability you know when you

1749
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:51,690
think about simply yield gains right you

1750
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:53,850
can translate that into monetary value

1751
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:56,940
by multiplying the quantity of

1752
01:20:53,850 --> 01:21:00,660
production increased multiplied by the

1753
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:03,270
price of the crop that involved so that

1754
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:05,540
gives it a monetary value income of

1755
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:08,370
course is a monetary phenomenon welfare

1756
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:12,210
can be measured in other ways apart from

1757
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:15,390
income in both monetary and non-monetary

1758
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:17,730
ways there are lots of different ways to

1759
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:20,940
measure these things and they can you

1760
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:25,320
know be boiled down to two monetary

1761
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:26,760
measures or non-monetary as well what's

1762
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,530
important I think is you know to get a

1763
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,300
sense of sort of the you know the rate

1764
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:32,930
of the differences in the rate of change

1765
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:37,140
you know that are attributable to two

1766
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:40,110
extension and those levels and trends

1767
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:43,640
are what gives us a sense of performance

1768
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:43,640
and impact thank you

1769
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:54,820
thank you so much David all right so

1770
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:57,670
we've had a lot of questions come in

1771
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:59,230
some really great discussion we really

1772
01:21:57,670 --> 01:22:02,020
really appreciate all of you who have

1773
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:03,640
joined us as attendees liberally sharing

1774
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:07,300
your questions and comments they're very

1775
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:10,120
helpful to the delecti who are helping

1776
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:12,520
to create these metrics and of course

1777
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:14,800
joining the DLX community of practice is

1778
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:17,530
one of the best ways to continue to stay

1779
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:19,420
informed on this topic in addition we'll

1780
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:21,160
be sending out an email with the

1781
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:23,140
recording of this webinar the

1782
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:26,410
powerpoints a few additional resources

1783
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:27,880
the chatbox transcript etc and in that

1784
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:30,250
email we'll be sure to communicate any

1785
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:33,850
essential follow-up actions from this

1786
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:35,860
webinar so I'd like to go ahead and wrap

1787
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:38,410
up the webinar and say a sincere thank

1788
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:40,810
