  "text": "yes and now we are discussing about agricultural videos in that tutorial we are discussing about grain farming process what is the process of grain growing these steps include planting growing harvesting threshing and restoring the final product by breaking down each step of the process you will gain a better understanding of how to produce a high quality product with minimal waste and the next point is what are the steps in processing grains primary processing involves several different processes designed to clean sort and remove inedible fractions from the grains primary processing of cereals includes cleaning grading heel hurling Milling pounding grinding tempering proper par boiling soaking drying and sieving and the next point is what are the seven steps of agriculture the seven steps involved in agriculture in agricultural stamina steps involved in agriculture practices are mentioned below probing sowing adding nutrients irrigation producting protecting plants harvesting and Storage our next point is what are the five stages of grain Oaks decimal growth scale is based on 10 cereal growth stages these are germination number one is germination seeding growth seedling growth then a Tailoring then stem elongation under booting next year emergence then flowering then milk development then the dove development under ripening these are the five stages of a grain next point is what are the six stages of grain farming let us learn about how to form grains in six simple steps understand the forms production goals survey the Farmland prepare the Farm soil finally the Farm soil Harvest and thresh the grains store the grains our next point is what are the methods of green harvesting with cereals the crop is first cut either as a whole are partially and then the threshed and clean to separate the grain from the years and strong in the latter case two main Alternatives exist separate harvesting and threshing our combined harvesting and refreshing and the next point is what are the seven steps of grains there are many different types of grains but some of the most common types of grains are wheat barley Woods and rice and common types of grains to eat is wheat rice barley oats quinoa that is q u i n o a kuna and Rai means Rye and next point is what tools do green farmers use while a truck is often stamped of a farming life there are several other Farms specific vehicles too attract us to say that a tractor is a broad category is an understand underestimate understand understatement a broad category is an understatement combine or Harvester ATV or UTV close Harrows fertilizer system spreaders Cedars under balance next point is what are 10 examples of grains the examples of all whole grains and whole grain foods include barley bulgar Furrow Millet that is q-u-i-n-o-a black rice brown rice and then red rice next point is what are the steps of farming agricultural and Agriculture and agricultural practices soil preparation before raising a crop the soil is the soil in which it is to be grown is prepared by a plowing leveling and manuring sowing selection of seeds of good quality crop strains is the primary stage of sowing manure irrigation weeding harvesting storage what are the farming methods permaculture biodynamic farming hydroponic phonics and anapon aquaponics Urban agriculture agroforestry and food forests in the farming methods Hydroponics and aquaponics is very good subject and science next point is what is the life of farming cultivation processing packaging Transportation consumption disposal what are the most common green topics green types next point is what are the most common grain types rice corn and wheat are the most common stable food on yet grains are so important because they are a good source of important nutrients called carbohydrates carbohydrates are a type of sugar that provides energy for organisms to function the next point is what are the three common methods of preparing grains the three most basic techniques for cooking grains are boiling absorption and steaming lend the best ways to prepare and cook different grain times including some different cooking techniques including frying stir frying still frying and banking next point is which machine is used to cut grain crops a machine used for cutting the mature crop is Harvester what is the next point is what is the best method of farming taking on agroforestry practices this is one of the best farming techniques using natural resources mixing in trees within your farming operations these trees provide shade and shelter for plants and animals in addition they provide extra income by allowing you to sell food or Lumber next point is what is the traditional method of processing the grain traditional Crossing is usually referred to as primary or secondary milling and grinding the grain are considered primary processing processes for example while baking the grain into Brent in secondary processing the less acceptable form of a processed food is the result of territory tertiary processing this is the information regarding grain farming and processing brain forming process it is most important and it will be this video will be useful to so much the methods of Performing processes Etc by agricultural risks wishing you all the best",
