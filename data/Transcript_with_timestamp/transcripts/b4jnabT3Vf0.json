  "text": "until first of all thank you everyone for taking your time and becoming part of lives every now this webinar is part of partners and prosperities multilingual webinar series where we are trying to mobilize and spend awareness about water management importance of water conservation in half developed techniques the water can be managed well in agricultural my name is Krishna Sharma and I am working as a coordinator in policy impact with partners in prosperity now I will just introduce you to a project called web Peru which we have been doing from last five years now so underwater at this water productivity project or web Pro we're essentially trying to create a dream value chains where the rice is produced using water efficient farming techniques and the protocol rice is exported to market partners like cocoa Mars and lt foods anyone would like to know more about it can speak to me personally going ahead into the discussion I will just introduce to his speakers first we have this lovely equipments thank you so much lucky for being part of developing now she is what she is heading the global sustainable sourcing part it Mars food currently she has been working in areas of project management as well as ask you to kind in you tell we can still have been noise in zebra girl yeah children working in project management as well as developing sustainable sourcing strategies Thank You Loki for joining us then dr. Kamal Bhatia has still not joined us I cannot share same hands up now moving to the next speaker we have dr. su di giotto thank you so much for being part of today's session leave the senior scientist at IRI International Rice Research Institute currently he is leading the team of environmentally sustainable methods in rice based system then we have two mr. SP Sharma he is the director at Central Water Commission Ministry of Water Resources they were development under river development Ganga rejuvenation Government of India and as he said his news presentation based own and not necessarily representing the government or his department's opinions who can go ahead with the discussion I'm just keep the lead to mr. Sharma now and we will discuss the first question which is what is the importance of water in agriculture and how we can manage it dr. Sharma over to you thank you good afternoon everyone answer to the question what is the importance of water in agriculture I would like to start from a little a little with a little perspective at the time of Independence our population was only 33 rows 330 million now we have 1.3 billion and the agriculture issue was such that at that time we were not finding it possible to feed our own people no we have done a lot of management issues they have less they have strictly because you see what was correct at that time Green Revolution now things have changed now we have become population but we were then and there are some serious quality issues quantity issues of water no to the question what is the importance of water in agriculture now it is the chicken tree but whatever we have whatever resources whatever inputs we have owned over at our disposal we must leverage that we must erase them forever benefit and what do we have here is water there are some countries which are which are quite water deficient for example in Israel the per unit water fill ability is less than and we are currently it is approximately only mr. Shah we can't show you I think there's some technical issue hello yeah yes yes so we can hear you not me okay so what you see first coming back to the question what is a big future in agriculture water is very much important because it is one of the few resources which we have at our disposal if we can leverage to feed of paper to keep our country stable and prosperous and and all the rest so we cannot straightaway discount water and we cannot also leave aside the issues of environment about quality and all so when we will really need is to have a multi-faceted approach in my opinion my personal opinion we cannot straightaway neglect over supply supply side by side results or splice side our answers and either we can neglect our demand side options we have to manage incident so I think this is this is how I would like to conclude is that we will have to manage it by making a very fine a very delicate balance between our demand side solution and supply side solutions we cannot straight away we remain dependent upon one of them thank you thank you mr. Sharma thank you so much for sharing movies you will absolutely correct that how there should be balanced well maintained between how much with demanding and how much reproduce in against what resources are involved because often what's the debate is that I'll be really selling our crops of - rice or really selling water so if you manage a water well then of course I can be looked after thank you so much I could request you to meet you video coming to the next questions which is again one of the very important question is understanding the basics of what we're trying to do and what is sustainable agriculture really and right now to Delpy have with us water and environment crew from Uttarakhand who has done extensive work in developing water management techniques and you also have farmers in Haryana we are trying to replicate this model but before getting into them and listening to definitions and views I would request Lockett to present how he was on this second question what is technically go to sustainable agriculture and why do we need it thank you so much for the opportunity to share more about what is sustainable agriculture and and why do we need it and maybe from the perspective of a global big company and I would like to share my screen that you need to give me permission Sherman okay thank you if you can see my screen please let me know you can't see or you cannot share if you can see it let me know I can't scream yes you can yeah okay excellent okay so I work for Mars food to be part of the big mass Inc company and we are owners of the biggest global rice friends and today I would like to share a little bit background like why sustainable rice becomes more and more important in countries like Europe the US but why it's also like Mars so first of all as Marsh family and we find it very important that we can make it impacts so it's important we can drive change we can also can so can everyone go on mute please yeah I think yeah good and driving impact is key and also we identified within Mars our top products and we can see that rice which is using 40% of the world's irrigation available as business we shoot X upon what's a reduction so that's something we do yeah also why sustain rice is important it's also important that's we can source basmati it's growing it's growing in Europe it's growing in the stage people want to eat this fragrant rice so it's import we have we can source from India so it's important we can source quality and health safety rice it's always number one but we also think in the future so also we want to source our vast matting right so we need a long-term supply well if water aquifers are dropping we need to act upon this we need to think in the future for that reason we are now partnering in the voucher program in we really want safer water stewardship approach and we also have basmati rice in ten years time even though we're very small of course but for that reason we've partnering with our suppliers but we also very active in platforms as well like the sustainable rice platform yeah another aspects like why is sustainability important it's it's important for own and so shit's our own employees in Mars and of course we also need to change it into into growth in the business so for instance but now you see it's very important consumers they want to know where is their food coming from it's called a trust chain they want to know where it's grown where it's coming from and we do this for instance by putting stories on the back of the back and we show how much water is saved and by farmers that grow yet great basmati rice so having this in mind this is more like saying why why it's so important that we work on sustainability thinking about the future yeah then as a business we have set goals so we said we can't do it on our own so we member and take a leadership in the rice platform and I think that's that's also something we're now working on an India we have plans maybe to set up a national chapter about sustained rise platform we also said we want to source rice from the sustainer rice platform standard that's one way how you can measure that Farms are growing sustainable rice which is key but we also say this is not enough so we also say farmers they need income otherwise it cannot join and profit from any program so we need to improve yields have meta access to finance think also let's see how farmers can sell their products like straw so we need to work on income and today's topic is about what I use so in high water stress areas we need to reduce the water use and of course this is all linked to it each other we can not only booze [Music] so we locate and there's some technical issue I can't show you properly do it also my partner switch in okay okay sure did you hear my previous slides like the goals properly yeah should I do it again yes really nice okay yeah so as a company we have set goals and first of all we acknowledge we cannot do it on our own so for that reason we have joined the sustain will rise platform both the platform as well as adopting the rice standards and we also really supporting deaths in India we set up a national chapter so that actors can be united in yeah it's locating for sustainable rice we in our goals we don't only see it as SRP is the only one solution we also work on income and what our use so that means we need to work on better work capital for rice growers increasing yields lowering input costs as well we see it we need to work on water stewardship and all the goals of course are interlinked together and something reshoots and bets in in a similar framework could you hear me now yeah we do we are with you okay okay good yeah we can't do it on our own so we very active with a lot of different partners we're having who know this context very well and we work closely with our suppliers we are very advocating that we work through Miller associations to really drive sector change there may be the final slides um what we always see that we need to to think about the future long term view so we need to think how can we change the system so I would dream our vision is Haryana shoots be an attractive area that we can source high quality basmati you know it's efficient water in the future but it only starts with if rice farmers they are entrepreneurs they think as enterpreneurs so grow rice and wheat in a system and as well also farmers they become stewards themselves of the environments yeah they need this well-functioning egg reserve system so good governance should be there there should be a good private sector supporting them so what we do now we work with our partners on having a goods rice value chain we need to work on adoption of climate smart practices and we need to improve the enabling environment so the policy parts yeah yep I would stop here and then give it next speaker yeah thank you okay in fact injury is very important points but says that farmers have to start working is what rusty was really however my question really is as a farmer as someone who is directly working one team when someone has to make a choice they need to to understand the business model so when you say the farmers have to become entrepreneurs they also have to find the utility of choosing what are efficient techniques over the conventional farming techniques will fear anything - anything to add on that but yeah ISO agreed the business case should be very clear so we always see the income going hands and hands with water so for instance we work now on a pre finance model to get away the rabble bank so that farmers can do for instance lace telephony as a technique which also will increase yields as well it will reduce water as well so that's just one example and as well we look at for instance how we can use the byproducts of rice for instance they sell the straw so we always need to think through longer term you have this model as well yeah yeah absolutely correct now I would like to open our slow to four questions to the farmers were sitting directly in Haryana in fact it is important that you raised the point of virgon at the facility six percent of the exported rice is a load coming from Indiana of the whole of the country so I would request my colleague in taking hurry on up ability to kindly open his video and maybe we can hear from what farmers have to say goodbye remove cakana cheerio what is the importance of local give me a minute and drink translate and understand what Angie a British attorney I think there's some confusion but because it may be I want to use the chat section so that we can read the question from there [Music] [Music] a partner for general efficient lucky and it's fishermen who spoke a while back I would request any one of you would know who would like to take this question I think should magic us anymore so now people would like to address this question that how rainwater can be used actually I think Sudhir might be the best one to answer because he's more than water specialist of Irie I can give my thoughts for collecting rainwater I better leave it to the more what a specialist yeah not just a date if you would we can't hear you dr. Safir if you can maybe try to unmute dr. Safir we continue I think there's something you you can you hear me now yeah I'm so sorry yes yeah it's all technology um so thank you very much and I'm very glad to see you know all farmers and just just inform them I'm also from Haryana so that's very kind of good moment to see people from my state the question which has been asked and and performer I'm sitting in Manila working for a internationalisation for rice so the question which has been asked I think question is not how to you know usually in water I'm looking at the chat box for how to help in raising the groundwater table which is kind of related question that so there is a two-part first we need to understand why groundwater is going down so that's the first part and the second part is how we can help so there has been a lot of research done by by universities by I see our Center on how you can capture rainwater and how that can be kind of linked to the aquifer so the basically there has been work done by different centers where at the corner of your their field they kind of installed a a bore well if you want to call it and then that that act as a water harvesting and the rainwater goes directly to the keeper so the first part is that by that whatever runoff is happening that goes to your aquifer but the more importantly thing is that the the degree with which we can recharge the groundwater that is still less than the rate which we are extracting the water so I think we need to also control the extraction path that how we will reduce our extraction so that the depletion rate can be reduced so we feel stop here thank you so much theater for your sharing good news with us and what you says it's it's very important that house some techniques which has to be introduced on ground needs to be done and just move into the next question which we have from Rockland is the what techniques can be adopted in Robbie crop management will be independent withdrawn water sources so if any of us because would like to answer this question of any doctors to distance me you are this example or something right and you know again yes the question is not for rice that's for OB season and it's very very interesting that how we look from the system perspective not only from from rice or or abhi season there has been a lot of work done in eastern India ass face in eastern occur for days specie they are I'm sure some of the farmers are friendlier about briceida dries and then not for rice but then they go for only seeing Oh beat to kept up the residual soil moisture with this small and be serious about what we call window operation you can reduce one irrigation so there is a lot of work going on how in eastern purposes basically we talk about you know two to three degrees and maximum to irrigation so if you can with system thinking if you can capture the residual moisture from rice starting early with be dries with briceida dries and then capturing residual moisture going with that's not in efficient you pee but in lot of work in punjab haryana is going on using straw as a mulch so with happy cereal lot of work is going on in Haryana but that's not much input for this in Uttar Pradesh I think there is a lot of scope to go for early planting of weight and using the regular moisture of rice rather than wasting it yeah thank you so much dr. su th by telling you sir that how the byproducts capacity Q's we have couple of questions coming over and we would like us because to ask them unfortunately we didn't adopt ricotta with us in everything as we would go forward and move in towards the third question we would have these answered questions answered in the next session would close the question on special for now and then went to the third question of today's presentation which is how can technology be used in improvising agricultural practices so dr. Spier if you can enlighten us with your views sure and I think this will also help to address some of the questions which are coming which are indeed very interesting so when we talk about how technology can be used in provide aggregate share practices I think we need to think about what we mean by technologies people in you know see technology from different perspectives technology because we per se kind of practice you know the tools so the the recommendation we kind of enabling tools to ease the decision-making and technology can be also in terms of catalyzing the adoption of improved practices so it depends on how we define that technology and I will briefly talk about all three so when we say about technology so people generally say technology as something new a new product motions are coming like drip irrigation sand and documents and about laser labeling so it depends on what is our purpose is if our purpose is kind of applying the less irrigation water then we can go with the technology like laser leveling so laser leveling will basically what will it will help that the amount of water which you applied whether you apply like five centimeter standing water ten centimeter whatever you apply it to reach to that AMA level the water quality require will be less and I think at least in India there has been sufficient adoption of laser leveling a load in punjab haryana but now it's speaking in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar alone and there is a clear visible benefit of laser leveling in terms of reducing the water and and increasing the yield but then also if there are other technology like if you don't know if you want to reduce or you want to increase the interval between two irrigations so how frequently you are applying irrigation and then the technology like alternate wetting and drying which is again quite quite famous now in South Asia that you you should have continuous flooding you can dry your field to certain level and there is a simple tool to do that but then we also talked about technology where you can reduce the amount of water but you cannot reduce the frequency so it's a frequent a flash application of water that is brief so in brief we have a technology where the amount of water can be significantly reduced but you need to apply it like more or less daily because it meet the idea for translating demand so the point here is it depends on what is the what are the challenges in the reason similarly when it's come to water it's not only water per se it's also energy in punjab and haryana it's most of the pumps are on on electricity as we go down in the eastern side there is a lot of diesel operated pump and then it comes to lydic how we can reduce the energy footprints also and there are different solutions easily in the in the coastal regions there has been lot of adoption of axial flow pump compared to centrifugal pump where your energy put pins can be significantly reduced or there has been lot of projects now started by by Government of India on solar power so it's kind of green energy using the green energy this is one one lens using irrigation or energy the other lens in terms of improving the adaptation you know tapestry of the farmer and in that one some of the farmer asked about water harvesting so basically if you if you can harvest the water that improve your you know capacity to adapt you know like if you are going through drought so you can apply supplemental irrigation and there is a lot of work done on on clove estimation method like dry seeded rice but if if you can allow me to share the screen pista if I can you hear me okay thank you then can you see my my screen I I think you are mute so I'm assuming that you are able to see yes yes i'm able to seem sorry african to the screen yeah oh okay can you see now not really we can't see you scream you need to kick twice like air and then you need to do a lot more permission step I think twice and then yeah yet now we can okay you can you can see so basically what it went to different screen so not sure this screen you are looking at all right let's listen yeah okay let let let's get it simple so what I mean here that we generally as a as a researcher we generally offer lot of technology to farmers and sometimes made them contribute we sometimes we are very much ecology driven and in real sense I think what farmers need help on is making a decision that what what are the best way to make that decision what technology can be picked and technology know is not only about like following laser leveling or not the decision is whether laser leveling is required or not or after how many years later learning is required whether for your system I repeat is a good option so maybe you are getting in a frame you you target the system game so there is a lot of work which is required in terms of helping farmer in decision making and now he was talking about enabling environment and this is similar to that one that where you invest on building the capacity of the system that is also with policy lens but then now there are lot of ICT IOT based tool which are very powerful in terms of picking the right at newly which are suitable for a particular reason farmers in haryana their questions are different than farmers in purple bays and farmers in bihar so we cannot fit one size to all and it's very very important that we we use now the tools in terms of leaving it with farmers I have been telling that this is best for you leaving with them to pick what is best for them because they are the kind of best people to understand the regular environment understand their challenge and I think what we can do is helping them in terms of exploring the cafeteria of technologies and and telling them the pros and cons of different technologies and and then these can also help to catalyze the chains which are required you can see that it's there is one more slide which is basically saying that we have technologies but and we know the stakeholder need but technology them generally doesn't reach to the stakeholders and that's the gap which we need to fill that how how what kind of now tools we can develop so that we can reach add metal near to farmers I'll stop here for now all right thank you so much dr. Sudhir you're absolutely correct in how we have been we do need to enable these farmers to make it informed choice and it and this enabling factor who could have multiple values one could be to give them the appropriate information of whatever kind of facility is available the kind of videos or just share the screen or even at the part of the government of what in terms of what kind of initiatives in the schemes are available for example subsidies we have been involved in this part of enabling farmers by training them in various kinds of for a few water efficient farming techniques and one of which was water stewardship which was being done under our water productivity project so Joanna from our Auckland office is connected to us and we have three and four charities who were the community persons working directly with the farmers on how they developed and also made sure that the farmers know what they're doing and also explaining them that how they can implement these shrim last many years so maybe we could hear her views and also head directly from some of our jockeys if you would allow me just like a New Year's yes yes I would like to hear Lennon just before getting into that we're really glad that we have apples from Pakistan and joining us Bonita Bernard who are implementing the virtual productivity project in Pakistan which we have been doing in India so to hear their views as well something and yeah drugs man yes yep just life you know can tell us about the experience of working within the community and nibbling the families and how Joseph Lee's worked directly on what using technologies and see all these technologies have been demonstrated in the field areas terrain is a ruby and intercropping jilsuk he told was to monitor the level of water and irrigation during the past three years and as the result we heard analyzed in twenty five percent of water saving has been twenty three to twenty five percent water saving has been experienced to these practices so genifique is this water monitoring part they are created water and environment groups in the region of many tablets chips that our project is pain is going on so the water and environment meaning purpose is to monitor and mean it mainly in the water infrastructure and where community members towards what reusable water tunes yeah in fact for everyone we have been successfully able to mobilize country in four thousand five that farmers in a project and how this word of mouth works among the farmers community is that when someone village or say a particular block is being trained or being told about what is happening it's it's slowly a rights among the other farmers and again what love who is talking about that if you present them with a lucrative business model which is that if they're producing water-efficient or maybe as artists and there's rice that can be easily exported and given at a good price if I'm correct okay yes absolutely well since we're done with the what the speakers has to say will be still one question left I would request a wrap low fat burn and Pakistan if they would want to then there's online questions as well like what are the low-cost technology that can be adopted by farmers without even increasing costs yeah yeah if you would like to go ahead and do answers because here and then went right into questions so alia joined us from Pakistan I like a new heroes he's Amanda without proper dress I think the sub Technicolor role in the country anyway let's go ahead and take answers one questions one-by-one so can drip irrigation system they using particle duration and that's something a reoccurring question and I think dr. Sudhir you would like to give your opinion um so yes definitely there has been lot of work done of using drip you know in rice I'm familiar the work was done in Haryana and canal work was done in Modi Purim also work was done however there is another question that can be it's kind of safe water without additional investment you know so that's kind of the scenario that when it comes to the paddy cultivation the initial investment with the drip and the technology is still kind of settling among speaking from my perspective that from its it's definitely there is a research done but for adoption of farmer it's still bit expensive so that now the many many private companies are working on low post drip irrigation system but the the adoption for drip is still low in very low in in rice because they they don't see kind of the output against the investment so the marginal quote is very high while in lot of rain fed area in Uttar Pradesh we have followed from there and they have started to use this low post drip irrigation in the dry season for growing vegetables and they like it's it's very high profitable system so it all depends on the technologies excellent but when farmer PK technology it's not only from technology perspective they look it from different lens so and that this depends on the whole system that what kind of system you have and then whether drip is a potential choice for you alone yeah yeah of course in fact they have been we have in the project which will be working in Haryana have been discussions whether we put implement drip irrigation in paddy cultivation and see can work that but we're also considering the factor that it has been done before but in different kinds of atmosphere and also the soil and I am skeptical about if the kind of soil will make any difference because the Illyria's will be different in in comparison to mummy beef because like Haryana so no they so the it depends on there are two different things one is when you schedule irrigation and how you scheduling is and whether you use drip or you use flood that is how when is interval and when will take care of soil type so when in deep irrigation you consider the evapotranspiration so you have pressure is from the soil transmission is on the plants so you consider that one and you schedule by irrigation but my my simple kind of question or suggestion to farmers and I'm thinking more like a farmers being on up in Haryana like if farmers are at least some progressive farmer are started to think for for drip so which means they are only thinking to dry their fatty fill if if they can dry they paddy field with surface irrigation they can save a lot I'm not saying that you know rape is good it can further increase the saving but in terms of what low-hanging opportunity which we have with us is saving this water which we are pumping from the ground water and that is really really kind of alarming the situation in punjab and haryana first i think the big message is that if they believed rupees good thats mean rice can be grown and like other serious like wheat so they can change it in their surface irrigation system also and then it's a step change then they can adopt really big at later states yeah yeah thank you dr. Sudhir of course what you said definitely can be done so this question which is a bit convoluted with just you giving the gist is really that what are the policy level initiatives that can guide water stewardship at a multi-level so it can be implement so really what the question is trying to understand is what kind of policy change is required when water stewardship can be implemented very well in all like in regional setting in a state level setting or say a national and even international setting if lauki would like to comment and maybe later doctor City it would give his own opinion on it yeah I'm I'm not Leslie the expert of course in the in the policy parts because this is I think maybe Sharma you even might be yourself able to answer of course like having improved policies having incentives for rice growers is essential so I spoke really about the enabling environments what we see for instance in other regions where the government might have incentives for collecting rainwater for providing subsidies for using drip irrigation that's one rule then of course also policies in place where maybe there might be a restriction of farmers using water in Pakistan there debates whether actually water should be paid by farmers so it just depends on the context of course yeah yeah but says you're someone who can speak for the market I would like to know your views and what capacity markets can influence the policy what kind of kind of change can be done from your end for example the points raised before was how they can increase price and we are working with SRP or something yeah so if we talk about premiums as March we need high quality basmati so we always pay for a quality premium in farmers so that already helps farmers to increase their income then we of course we work with our suppliers who have acronym is to provide coaching to farmers so every two weeks they will receive guidance how to better grow the rice which also increased yields by 15% of course we also work on improving let's say better markets so market route to markets transport lowering transport costs and then of course if they grow SFP rice we we won't expect we pay a premium I do in organics which we would rather see by all the interventions that farms can benefits by growing rice in a more sustainable way yeah Annie I can add and to allow in terms of incentivize farmers for kind of climate smart practices one of the one of the debate which is going on is on providing incentives to farmers for carbon correct which has been already started in investing word but in a CIT is not introduced and there has been and this is a macro level at at country level and country whole different kind of funds the one is which we they can access his Green Climate Fund which can be Kentucky laid down for to provide a you know additional incentive for reducing the water footprint and and carbon footprint so as you know that rice is one of the major source of methane emission so it can be sometime direct some time indirect so if they they use the water efficiently they not only save water but they also reduce the global global warming potential so people of Haryana know that what is happening in the h\u00e9l\u00e8ne in inventory you know so there is a lot of work need to be done in terms of how we we do how we improve the egg practices but more importantly what what is the pull mechanism and that I think we need to think out of the box to incentivize farmers through premium rice coding price or through these new incentive mechanism of carbon footprints yeah yeah thank you so much dr. city for adding your reviews and of course methane emissions was a very important side effects of brown rice and it we are contributing towards not generating that kind of emission into theaters we're considering Delhi is the UM India's pollution level that will be put into one station in terms of the ecological their contribution from the farmers end but the Diskin solid always comes to me as it moves from us from you know putting my faith in a farmers show is that why is there everything Bertrand oh honey why do I have to need to make all the difficult choices because essentially what matters to me is growing and just getting the better price so if you would like to comment on that I will now give you anything I would not say it's always about the price it's more what we say the more crop per acre so productivity that that's a clicky one also what we see a lot in the system that a lot of rice growers are dependent on a middleman to have loans to need to pre finance their input costs and that actually is a huge burden on the on the final net income from rice so we now might be working more on pre finance which can reduce 20% of their financial of their input costs which are spent by paying fourteen to twenty four percent of Texas so rather just having the premium discussions I would rather go in in these roots thinking about refinancing dependency or middlemen and whether we can also play a role in this and I came to here because I know it's very challenging as a full of rice growers also needs middlemen as their provide a bank not only for agriculture but also for education and other other let's say loans as well yeah thank you okay adding to that I think one of the participants with us as dr. sedative saying was directed at I CIT International Organization for irrigation and drainage maybe he would he would be an expert person to add comments on how changes can be done at a policy level doctor sedative if you would like to add a special if you would unmute yourself you can't hear you yes you what does that I can't hear you yeah maybe I don't want to spoil the party but this morning I was reading the newspaper and interestingly there is a study by a Policy Research Institute which says that the crab burning in Haryana Punjab alone costs us dollar 30 billions per year to the Indian economy and I don't know I think that's a very death that's a number which is very close to the total agricultural exports of India basically the punjab haryana reason is not the agro-ecological jewel for rice farming and it was introduced because of the Bhakra Nangal then then which provided sufficient water so people says to the cash crops like the basmati rice which is an export commodity so maybe I had been studying this problem for last 2-3 years and it seems that Punjab and Haryana received only 40 percent of the monsoon rain that the West Bengal and the northeastern part of India which are more suitable for rice farming we see and I don't see any research which gives a direction that how we can grow federal trials like basmati in the northeast parts of India which state ships adequate once on the info and in the Punjab Haryana region but I am NOT against technology I mean I'm an engineer myself and drape and all these things can always make the water use efficiency much higher but should we not be practicing something something which is ecologically or ecologically sustainable that's that's my question to the experts here of course there is a need for into improving the economy of farmers improving their income but are there other ways which we should we should think about or there are other options policy options which can incentivize the shift in farming practices making it more ecologically sustainable in the longer yes thank you dr. Sade for sharing your views I know you're short of time but we have two questions which are still left unanswered if you could keep it on the table now the first one is how can white water stewardship affect the quality and quantity of daily culture to do so essentially what is the benefit of what stewardship so if you would like to heal electricity so basically when we are seeing about whenever we talk about water saving people sometimes take it as like we are cutting off significantly it's there is a difference between water requirement of krob versus water applied to the crew and they're basically it's all about the intelligence about like how much water need to be applied I I want to quickly also make the point about what Sade was saying that I also believe in terms of the whole window operation thinking about how you can make decision based on your ideological condition and based on your water ability so you are the some of the like I know the verbage Mars food is doing the attach managing practices that the climate smart practices which will not affect your quantity that may improve your quality but David that will definitely not affect your quality so it's win-win situation which basically we are talking here rather than reducing quantity and quality yeah absolutely it makes also a lot of sense because it we are conserving water and managing water not only are we making an ecologically better choice between so in terms of the market making you know a better repository as raised by Lao K that how premium is also being paid by companies and for that matter I know that Mars has been paying premiums LT Foods and other market features also paying premium for better maintained rice just this last question which is being left unanswered is the what is what are the low cost technologies that can be adopted by farmers without increasing cost um again I think it depends on I always go back to that what are the what are the conditions rather than saying that this technology can be can fit very well to you we have seen a very very high impact and again today was talking about this HP study and another if we study in eastern refer this fear the the early planting of wheat followed by ugly planting of so early planting a price followed by early planting of beef was able to make significant change in water productivity because they were using rain efficiently so it's not always that you need to try a new rotate it's sometime it's the decisions which you make around the production system there are series of technologies which which can can be adopted but again I would come back to that it all depends on what are the conditions and accordingly we can we can suggest the appropriate technologies thank you so much dr. city for sharing your time and your use with us I think we just ending the very nice already 332 and Tetris of internet problem P also don't have a love cake would be does as of now so first of all I would like to thank everyone for sharing their views and the participants from red yellow rock and Pakistan and different parts of the country",
