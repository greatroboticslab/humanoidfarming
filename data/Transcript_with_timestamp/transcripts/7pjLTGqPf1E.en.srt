00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,600
hello my name is Leonor Rodriguez I am a

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,199
professor of Technical University of

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,840
Madrid and today I will be introducing a

4
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,599
little bit the elements for the D

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,519
irrigation systems what do you need to

6
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,280
know

7
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:38,280
when designing re Iration system in an

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:43,160
ecological Orchard organic Orchard the

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,760
orchard that we be on belongs to the

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,840
Technical University of Madrid and the

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,280
faculty of the

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,000
engineer agricultural engineering school

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,960
and we will see here the different

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,760
elements that the

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:05,840
systems need

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:08,600
to be aware of their characteristics and

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,439
they function it first things you need

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,400
to think of is about where the water is

19
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,079
how the water will be conveying to the

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,280
different small Orchards and if we are

21
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,720
talking about this irrigation systems

22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,479
you need to know that water will move

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:32,720
along

24
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:35,600
the circular pipe as this one and the

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,799
whole section will be filling with water

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,159
that means that pressure along the pie

27
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:46,159
will be higher than atmospheric pressure

28
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:49,880
Now we move on to see where the water

29
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:53,799
comes out in this particular or water

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:57,840
comes to this point from the central

31
00:01:53,799 --> 00:02:01,719
water uh company of Madrid it's called

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,640
Canal Isel sea this Lo in a special

33
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:08,759
places afterwards there is various

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,440
underneath the soil the different pipe

35
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,680
and it comes out in this point you will

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,000
see here this is

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,720
a hyraulic

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,440
Val this this one over here this is open

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,959
or close bar that goes forward to

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,800
connect

41
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,720
another five B of different material

42
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,319
this one is fibro cemento and the other

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:42,800
one is polyethylen the diameter of this

44
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,400
material is 40 mm and it comes along to

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:51,319
the whole

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:53,440
length of the F showing the

47
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:56,680
pressure at this

48
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,720
point but in this case it is connected

49
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,239
with a pressure regulator what do we

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,799
mean a pressure regulator here the

51
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:09,319
pressure of this pip could be as high as

52
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:12,680
17 and water M col so that is too high

53
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:15,640
for uh Bri Iration system so in that

54
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:20,120
case if we need a very high pressure

55
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:24,120
more than 20 or 30 H water met colum we

56
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:28,239
will need to use that pressure regulat

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:33,040
device in the point where the

58
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,959
distribution pi ends afterwards we'll

59
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,840
continue to

60
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:43,840
the head or the tail of the

61
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:48,560
different areas from the small Bri

62
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,560
irrigation system on this aricultural

63
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,840
oras and that five will be the same

64
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,239
diameter and the same material that's

65
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,599
this one you see over here this is also

66
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,079
bared let's move to see which are the

67
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:08,760
typical elements for adri irrigation

68
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:11,439
systems but first of all let me reminded

69
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,200
how much water you need to apply B

70
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,160
irrigation system how to calculate the

71
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,959
water requirements or each plants in

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:24,560
different Orchards it will depend on

73
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:29,880
variables such as climb precipitation

74
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:32,120
solar radiation wind soil structure

75
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,080
texture organic

76
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,880
matter and the

77
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,639
physiological behavior of each crop

78
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:45,360
there are public programs to calculate

79
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:49,840
this CLW requirements such as the crossw

80
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,320
by file that everyone can take Link into

81
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,759
those H specifical web download the

82
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,639
program and calculate the water

83
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,360
requirements for each gr and and each

84
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:05,199
location we know that information what

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:09,479
should we do what should we do next next

86
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:12,400
is decide which type of irrigation

87
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:15,280
system we need for our organic torture

88
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,759
like that we need a very efficient

89
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,919
irrigation systems if we think of the

90
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:25,039
barriers type of irrigations method

91
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,960
where we think of the surface irrigation

92
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,720
method is really too complicate nowadays

93
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,800
you can do it we can think of the splink

94
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,440
regation method but uh for that

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:44,680
Horticultural C is not worth it since we

96
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:49,520
have a many a evaporation losses and we

97
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:52,600
also need a very high pressure so the

98
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,960
best irrigation methods should be th

99
00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:00,560
irrigation methods this Iration method

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:04,199
it also has the advantage doesn't

101
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,039
be affected by wind so in the specifical

102
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,080
locations where the wind is could be a

103
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:11,599
problem that's the the method to go and

104
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,680
the efficiencies really very very high

105
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:16,599
is the the management of the system is

106
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,919
well organized

107
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:24,360
this so what are the

108
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:27,560
typical elements forre irrigation system

109
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,960
they are the drippers these are

110
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:36,800
different type of drippers that's this

111
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:39,960
online emitter emitter and they had the

112
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,800
advantage in case you will need several

113
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:50,599
dischs you can't do it with this small

114
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:56,199
tube we have a inal line emitters means

115
00:06:50,599 --> 00:07:00,560
that the path is cuted both ends and

116
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,680
inserted within the emitter

117
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,160
and the

118
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:10,319
most typical models are the integrated

119
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,319
model like that all of them have in

120
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:17,560
common our Labyrinth structure as you

121
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:23,240
can see here you will see that this a

122
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:27,360
Laing with um protu and different angles

123
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:30,120
what does this is required for as we

124
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,840
think of the three Iration system is a

125
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:38,759
localizing system that mean water

126
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:42,479
deserts drop by drop near the plant and

127
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,520
the pipe has a pressure over the

128
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,879
atmospheric pressure that's mean over

129
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:53,840
One bars we need an element to L to drop

130
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:56,960
off all pressure that means to keep it

131
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,159
close to atmospheric pressure what are

132
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,080
these elements usually the Labyrinth

133
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,960
so the water comes into this lence moves

134
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,800
along and then the discharge from the

135
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,599
different Outlet usually one or two

136
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,039
houret and when it is discharged this is

137
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:18,960
atmospheric pressure so that means that

138
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:21,800
water uh can't like it it it wear a drop

139
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,039
you can also try a home if you have a

140
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,800
pile like this by pressure try to punch

141
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:29,520
it a small hole you will see that there

142
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,120
is a jet free jet coming out that

143
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,839
doesn't mean

144
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,240
that even though you have the same

145
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:42,200
diameter outl from the meter this H the

146
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:45,160
meters and the one in the PIP you won't

147
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,120
see the same effect this is UN localized

148
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:52,800
because the labyrint and this is not

149
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:56,200
localized this a typical FL we

150
00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:02,120
observe that uh

151
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:07,680
you have a really tiny SE no more than 2

152
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:10,240
mm between 1 and 2 mm there so this is

153
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,640
one of the disadvantage of this system

154
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,200
you have to be aware that water is

155
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:21,040
doesn't

156
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:24,839
carry a small minerals with this so a

157
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,399
small organic matter that can PL those

158
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:31,200
section that means that emit with the

159
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,959
plug it and the discharge will be lower

160
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,200
than expected in order to avoid that

161
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,880
disadvantage you have

162
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,519
to

163
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,760
add to the system a filter the most

164
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:50,079
typical system for this irrigation

165
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:54,519
system is the dick filters this is a

166
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:58,720
very fine disc press it together water

167
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,920
comes from the outer part and the all

168
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,040
the material

169
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:09,399
that this coning with the water stay in

170
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:14,079
the greenest part of the of the this and

171
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:19,440
the clean water can to the inner part

172
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,440
and move to the irrigation

173
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:27,880
units well we know the elements and now

174
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:32,440
a question to answer is what should be

175
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:36,600
the optimum this chart for the meter

176
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:39,839
well you can have in the market from 1 L

177
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:44,760
per hour till 8 to 10 L per hour so this

178
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:47,800
is a a wi interval range what you

179
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:53,639
say when we are dealing with pressure

180
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:55,800
don't forget to leave a pressure G like

181
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,680
that at the beginning of the irrigation

182
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,800
unit that's the typical if this is liid

183
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,519
and you can

184
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:08,000
go there so it's time what the pressure

185
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,959
is otherwise you want to do that yes a l

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,600
a pressure button over there and go with

187
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:17,959
a digital manometer like this Sy time

188
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:22,600
you want and going with this element

189
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:27,320
that is connected to the digital

190
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:31,240
monometer punch it into the bottom

191
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,240
outlet and measure the pressure

192
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:41,440
finally we need a volume meter like that

193
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:45,120
that's the Walmart volume meter it can

194
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:49,760
be used for progamming the

195
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:53,760
irrigation or yes simple to pay the bill

196
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:58,519
of water that will canalot everyone or

197
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:01,839
two mon for this irrigation system we

198
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:07,360
have to an integrated model no

199
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:10,920
compensating 2.2 L per hour this is the

200
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,800
a design of the meter that

201
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,800
goes inside the

202
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:25,240
pipe now let's move to the orchin and

203
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:28,240
see how the irrigation unit

204
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,320
is as you remember this was the point

205
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,360
with the pressure Reg

206
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:39,440
and the pressure gut to know which is

207
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:44,000
the regulator the pressure at this time

208
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:47,399
and and in at every moment remember this

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,880
system has a pressure over

210
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:54,360
40 water colon meter even 60 water colon

211
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,160
meter because it comes to

212
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:02,040
the general

213
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:06,160
water networking from the city of M you

214
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:10,959
wouldn't have this pressure and that's

215
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:14,279
probably you may have in in in

216
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:18,240
feel located at the Summers of the big

217
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:21,680
cities you probably will have to install

218
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,079
a little pond at

219
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,160
the beginning of the whole system in

220
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:30,959
this case we don't need it we we need

221
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:33,079
the contrary we need to to drop off some

222
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,839
energy because the the the pressure is

223
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:40,399
really high and then it will just we

224
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:44,560
keep it there let's say between one and

225
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:50,880
two bars we move with the same diameter

226
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:55,759
for p 4 mm and we need to think of the

227
00:13:50,880 --> 00:14:00,360
best design for this CH and this

228
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:04,399
Orchards first you have to make all the

229
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,920
L settles for the plants that's the

230
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,600
first thing you need to be decided once

231
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,920
this is done the Iration system needs to

232
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,279
cover all the water Closs water

233
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,279
requirements for that

234
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:23,839
needs what should be the best designs

235
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:27,680
for this specific case we have try and

236
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:32,079
calculate different options and the best

237
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:36,079
we found in terms of Energy savings is

238
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,000
the one that takes the

239
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,079
same

240
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,759
P for water

241
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:50,320
distribution all along to the middle

242
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:55,839
area between this small clots and the

243
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,839
left and right clots that go in the

244
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:01,040
middle to the middle cor of the

245
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:08,680
here and from here is a split with two

246
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,360
Tes on two

247
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,320
different

248
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,320
containers each

249
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,320
containers will

250
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:22,399
dgate four different

251
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,240
blocks so we have one container inting

252
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,759
this four

253
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,720
blocks

254
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,519
behind this other

255
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,079
container will

256
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:38,880
irrigate this other four

257
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:42,519
clock and finally this is a symmetry

258
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,279
just think of in the v solution taking

259
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,279
into account symmetry as much as

260
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:49,959
possible according to the Topography of

261
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:52,440
the field and this last two the the the

262
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:56,800
lateral with move the final P will be

263
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,720
this one here and there is a coat elbows

264
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,920
that moves one to the left one to the

265
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,880
right and from here they will distribute

266
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:09,319
water from these four blocks and behind

267
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,279
from the other four blocks so once we

268
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:18,120
have

269
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:19,600
the p 40 mm SP here we need to change

270
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,160
diameters

271
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,519
usually for the

272
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,480
tertiary Pi this is this one 25 mm and

273
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:34,199
from the tertiary Pi we have the Cherry

274
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,199
pip that goes very close to the

275
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:40,880
blocks we'll move

276
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,880
to

277
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:54,560
the end of the plot down end of the plot

278
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:59,279
and in the middle part

279
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:02,279
we rise a little bit with a different

280
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:06,760
diameter polyethylen P this is usually

281
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:12,199
from 12 mm to 16 and we have an open and

282
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:15,000
close B to open and close the water

283
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,559
so each

284
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,319
container

285
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,760
will get water

286
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:27,280
for every four plots but you have to be

287
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:31,120
aware that water comes from the start

288
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:37,240
point that means that you have unlimited

289
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:41,240
water so in order to make a right

290
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:45,240
programing to irrigate simultaneously

291
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:50,400
one two three or four flock or even more

292
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:54,480
you won't have to surpass the quantity

293
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,840
of water delivered by the a start point

294
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,320
you can irrigate

295
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,240
simultaneously with as many units

296
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,240
as Water

297
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:13,080
Supplies we see here in the container

298
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:16,720
two different elements that um may be

299
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:20,280
very useful for this types of irrigation

300
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,280
one is

301
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,720
the electro

302
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:31,880
valve for irrigation programming this

303
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,720
types of program me is by time you said

304
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,880
that the time of

305
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:41,720
irrigation this is the open BX for here

306
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:46,799
this valve open and the irrigation will

307
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:50,039
go on to the different sub genit and we

308
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:53,280
have also in that case this element this

309
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:56,760
is a pressure reductor we say that at

310
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,280
the beginning it was a regulator

311
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:03,360
pressure that was

312
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:07,159
H setup to

313
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,840
2.2 bars and this

314
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:13,960
one

315
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:16,120
reduce the pressure at that point to 1.1

316
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,000
so that means that water that comes

317
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,240
along this

318
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,280
tary

319
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:31,480
pip will have no more than

320
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,480
1.2 bars the the other

321
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:36,360
element

322
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,799
beond

323
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:44,360
the electr and the pressure reactors is

324
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,360
the

325
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:54,720
volumeter

326
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:59,679
meter so it will lock all the volume of

327
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:02,799
water us it in its irrigation afterwards

328
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:07,039
we move along we

329
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:11,080
have the open and closed wall we saw

330
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:14,960
before and this is our small irrigation

331
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:20,559
unit it is compon of the tertiary

332
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:25,000
p and four laterals in that

333
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:30,600
case the distribution water is in the

334
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,360
middle we could have Chen other

335
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,440
designed taking the distribution of

336
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,120
water either in one side on the other

337
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,640
what will be the advantage

338
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:45,240
or Distributing the water that way means

339
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:50,720
that the pressure is more

340
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:54,960
compensated in both ends so we have the

341
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,600
laterals the laterals goes from one end

342
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,360
to the downstream

343
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,400
end

344
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:09,960
the emit expansions are choing according

345
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:14,159
to the CR physiological requirements the

346
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:17,799
cross planting in this case is 30 cm

347
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:23,799
apart for a typical D Rion units at the

348
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:28,000
end of its lateral we have a plaque to

349
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:32,080
stop the water running but in the skates

350
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,799
we have a non

351
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:40,240
branched design that means that the end

352
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:44,159
of the lateral are connected to

353
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,360
another part that means that water

354
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:50,679
moving from the upper stream going to

355
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,679
the down stream will move downwards and

356
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:57,480
can go to

357
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:59,960
reverse we attend with this Ty of design

358
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,440
that the pressure variability is you

359
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:06,400
know as higher so that will mean that we

360
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:10,159
have a more water distribution

361
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,159
uniformity and more

362
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:18,279
efficiency

363
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:23,080
so finally we don't need to forget what

364
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:27,200
is the pressure of each irrigation unit

365
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:30,159
so that means that we need a point where

366
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:34,159
we should

367
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,799
with the pressure it that case we are

368
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:43,640
using the pressure

369
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:46,640
button and will be locating in a

370
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,640
uni

371
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:55,799
pip that case how can we do that we to

372
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,440
use the puncher is that here we can buy

373
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:03,120
the puncher in

374
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:05,880
it small store gardening store or

375
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:10,880
supermarket and

376
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,880
we open a hole we

377
