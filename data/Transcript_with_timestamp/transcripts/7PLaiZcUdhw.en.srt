1
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,519
bushes

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,439
here one on the other side of the tree

3
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,439
not this

4
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:36,000
fall but last fall now one was a full

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:39,480
Bush and everyone was a dormant start

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,280
from Tractor Supply so we had one this

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,340
was the start here and then the other

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,059
one was a full on Bush now this is an

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,059
invasive monovic this is a non-invasive

10
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,100
type of Wisteria which here in the South

11
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,440
with Syria can be very invasive you'll

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,360
see it all over the highways climbing

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,699
through trees my mom has it in her

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,140
backyard her house is over 100 years old

15
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,300
and she has

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,280
what appears to be beautiful beautiful

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,460
Wisteria Vines but they will take over

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,900
your trees if they can jump onto your

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,360
house they will take over your house

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,880
anything they could climb on they will

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,520
take over and they can really choke out

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,500
a lot of ecosystems that you don't want

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,420
them to and that is the main problem

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,540
with invasive things is when they grow

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,640
places you don't want them to yeah my

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,500
non-invasive Vines

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,420
will not do that they will stay where

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,159
you put them you can cut them back they

29
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,159
will grow where you want Instagram which

30
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,799
is excellent unfortunately

31
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,860
the difference is that

32
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,840
you do have to help them to climb now

33
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,460
once they are truly truly truly

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,960
established they will start to find a

35
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,960
little

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,960
bit

37
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,680
we're going to climb up in the tree a

38
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,159
little bit

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,619
um now I bought mine from a nursery here

40
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,299
in town and they told me all the

41
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,100
differences between the invasive and the

42
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,460
non-invasive I did a whole video on this

43
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,380
I will link it down below um but again

44
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,500
the main difference is you have to help

45
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:14,480
it climb until it gets truly established

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,480
and that can take a couple years so

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,940
these whips that are coming off of those

48
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:28,140
branches off of line here

49
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:30,599
they need help climbing the tricks they

50
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,680
can't really do it on their own you can

51
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,680
see that they are

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,480
Outlets

53
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,160
along the ground I will do it a clip

54
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,959
right here to show you it goes all the

55
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,660
way over there's a really really long

56
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,480
lip on the other side of the tree going

57
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:52,340
along the ground by the garden so all of

58
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,340
those will help going around the tree

59
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,580
it's a little funny but they grow really

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,580
fast this is one Summer's worth of grow

61
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,580
th

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,900
these are still fairly blue Vines I've

63
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,239
only got one season of wounds out of

64
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,760
them this year and that one season was

65
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,980
about five to ten rooms

66
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,319
um the the ones at the nursery were

67
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,140
beautiful they had hundreds of ones so

68
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,780
maybe next year it's grown so much this

69
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,640
year it's grown you know almost 10 times

70
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,340
more than it grew last week at this

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,379
season so today all we're going to be

72
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,080
doing is taking these

73
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:36,480
little u-shaped snails do you change

74
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,360
nails and we're going to be helping to

75
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,060
attack the vine in place up around the

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,000
tree so that it can grow now the whole

77
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,360
reason I am growing these now

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,879
on this tree is that history

79
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,459
is a

80
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,980
is not doing supervised it's probably

81
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,180
not going to make it forever I'm not

82
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,140
going to get this

83
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,140
however

84
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,360
this is a big experiment when I move out

85
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,540
of this house I will be taking house

86
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,299
with needs a modular house but when I

87
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,659
move this tree will probably come down

88
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:17,060
and so the whole idea of this is to try

89
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:17,060
it out see our non-invasive lines

90
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,419
ever house we plant them somewhere where

91
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,340
they become an issue so for today

92
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm going to take our Hammer to go take

93
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,740
your nails and help guide these lines up

94
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,660
around the tree and if you have a tree

95
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,860
that is super important to you and is

96
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,199
not as sure

97
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,800
a lot of your sturdier trees will take

98
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,360
Nails in the bar some kids

99
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,540
so if you make sure you

100
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,740
can ask at your Nursery look for someone

101
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,740
to ask and your teacher

102
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,940
try um you know wrote me twine around

103
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,800
the branches to help keep guiding them

104
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,840
upwards and giving them a growing

105
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,120
support until they can reach something

106
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,180
up top to Anchor them into the tree

107
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,800
something that's a lot less detrimental

108
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,660
than that

109
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,699
that I'm not worried about we're using

110
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,419
Nails I've been doing this for almost

111
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:15,240
two years now and we have had no issues

112
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,639
but we are getting to the point where we

113
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,000
really need a top where I can't reach

114
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,020
and so on in the driveway now is my tall

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,639
brother

116
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,680
we've got a top brother and a tall

117
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,620
ladder we're gonna get this guy taken

118
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,780
care of so let's get started

119
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,660
gonna be a lot of me stretching divides

120
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,520
of him putting the nails on

121
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:38,539
all right so you're gonna place it right

122
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,539
over the Vine

123
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:47,460
yeah and you'll hammer it in just until

124
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,020
it is really in the bark

125
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,759
when you can you want to leave enough

126
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,680
room for the vine to still kind of move

127
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,860
around and grow

128
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,539
and that's it just keep on

129
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,539
pulling them up the tree

130
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,269

142
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,220
all right we got everything put up the

143
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:52,320
tree my phone overheated so I don't know

144
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,320
how much of it y'all saw

145
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,540
but we've got the big whip put up you

146
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,220
can see it up at the top it went all the

147
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,540
way to the top of the tree

148
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:05,760
and all the little ones are woven in now

149
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,779
I try to weave them so that the leaves

150
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,820
are

151
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:12,380
front face out because they grow with

152
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,380
front face out but you can see

153
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,519
will doesn't know that so he just puts

154
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,300
him up so he's got some back face ones

155
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,459
but

156
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,459
it's okay they go all the way up

157
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,580
oh that one probably could have been

158
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,120
tacked better you can see the end there

159
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,459
but you know what it's fine

160
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,019
and instead of literally the one whip we

161
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:36,420
had around at the beginning of the

162
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,279
Season we have a whole trunk full

163
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,600
and I'm really hoping that means next

164
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:45,480
year we will have a whole tree of blooms

165
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,839
this is time when buying an invasive

166
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Vine that would climb on its own sounds

167
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,519
really good but for the two years it's

168
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,160
been installed that I've had it planted

169
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,380
I'm falling over I only had to do this

170
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,540
two three times now obviously you saw

171
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,160
the whips I should have done this at

172
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,380
least two times this season and I

173
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,740
haven't so that's part of it

174
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,740
um but

175
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,680
lots of growth this year so I'm calling

176
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,779
that a win

177
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,019
I'm gonna go inside and get cool because

178
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,820
it's hot hot out here my brother has

179
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,580
already left he has

180
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,839
he has finished his uh brotherly Duty

181
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,420
for the day

182
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,800
I will see y'all in the next project

183
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,800
bye stay cool
