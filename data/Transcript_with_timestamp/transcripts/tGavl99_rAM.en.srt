00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
hey folks this josh tarney rich farmer

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,890
welcome to the farm blog today today

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,020
we're going to be working with the

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,630
tractor and the seed drill this is a

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,429
no-till seed drill made by hey buster

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,230
and we're going to be busting some hay

7
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,330
so we're gonna go out and all these bare

8
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,070
spots throughout the field and all the

9
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,140
land down here that we just had cleared

10
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,699
and you can see it's a whole lot of land

11
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,650
where we've got it cleared all down

12
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,939
through there we're gonna seed this land

13
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,560
okay so we've got fescue rye grass and

14
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:30,750
rye grain and that's what we're going to

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,910
be putting in here and also medium

16
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,440
Ladino clover so come along on the farm

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,420
vlog today we're gonna have a little bit

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,710
of fun loading up the hopper will show

19
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,329
you how it all works and we'll get out

20
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,160
of here and we'll drill some grain we'll

21
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,760
drill some grass seed and get this thing

22
00:00:41,160 --> 00:01:03,030
started alright let's have some fun

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:01:07,970
[Music]

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:11,610
[Applause]

25
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,680
guys I put this part in the vlog I was

26
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,540
going to cut it out but I just wanted

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,580
you to see what a struggle it is

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,560
sometimes just to hook up a piece of

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,200
equipment and I sped it up right here

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,140
but it took me nearly ten minutes just

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,670
to put this pin in you can see what a

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,700
struggle if you're not strong you really

33
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,340
can't do this kind of stuff so I get a

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,930
lot of flack for having a belly but man

35
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,060
you got to be a strong guy to handle

36
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,380
this kind of stuff it's it's big

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,360
equipment really hard alright guys this

38
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,100
is called the hey buster okay there are

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,990
three hoppers on this hey buster won't

40
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,340
take you up top and show you that here

41
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,780
in just a second but we're gonna walk

42
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,130
around first and we'll get it hooked to

43
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,540
the tractor okay I'll show you what we

44
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,400
have to do here we are at the back of

45
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,200
the seed drill here okay

46
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,810
these tubes that you're seeing down here

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,830
is what the seed drops down into okay

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,990
and we'll show you how all the

49
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,729
adjustments work this is the hydraulic

50
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,890
setup and these two hydraulic lines

51
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,979
right here go straight over here I have

52
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,780
some zip ties all set these zip ties

53
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,750
down they go right over here into our

54
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,890
rear secondary hydraulics okay so we'll

55
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,750
give them a little wipe down it's good

56
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,780
to have gloves for this and we'll pop

57
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:25,500
our secondary hydraulics loose right

58
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:28,110
there okay now here our hydraulics we

59
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,970
don't want our secondaries this is for

60
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,590
the front the grapple on the front of

61
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,319
the tractor we don't want them flopping

62
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,830
around here so that's why we have zip

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,080
ties

64
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,790
so we'll zip tie these guys up to where

65
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,310
they'll be in a good safe place out of

66
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:48,420
the way and they won't get pinched ask

67
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:50,310
me how I learned this okay alright guys

68
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,140
so here are hydraulic lines and we'll

69
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,450
hook those into our rear secondary

70
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,700
remotes and all you do is just push them

71
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,300
into place and they lock right in just

72
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,250
like this okay and they're locked into

73
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,380
place now we need to take a look at our

74
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,420
Dalek lines now our hydraulic line

75
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,250
cannot just be flopping around all over

76
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,980
everywhere but we see they've already

77
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,380
put some rope on here and the rope is

78
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,790
kind of loose so we got to know this is

79
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,830
what happens when they flop around

80
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,920
everywhere they'll get pinched right

81
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,660
inside there so

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,670
we've got to find a way to support these

83
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,830
and once again that's why we need our

84
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,120
zip ties so what I learned last time is

85
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,500
you got to take care of your hydraulic

86
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,620
line so we'll go down here with our zip

87
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:35,410
tie and we'll just zip tie this guy

88
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:38,230
right up here to our three-point hitch

89
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,400
thing I forgot what that's called guys

90
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,840
tell me what that thing's called I

91
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,030
forgot what it was what it's called I

92
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,440
know everybody knows what it is so now

93
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,790
you can see our hydraulic lines are

94
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,430
free-floating but they're not gonna get

95
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,310
into anything down here okay next thing

96
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,200
we'll show you how to adjust the hoppers

97
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,910
okay so there's a step here a step here

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,519
then you get up on this rail right here

99
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,830
okay I'm tall enough that I can reach up

100
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,110
here put the lid up when you flip the

101
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:05,019
lid you've got a guide right here that

102
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,480
tells you what you're running and tells

103
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:09,580
you what settings to put it on so we put

104
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,430
it on setting number eight for fescue

105
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,519
and that puts 23 you see the 23 that's

106
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,590
23 pounds per acre and then we have some

107
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,919
settings for the spring in the rear and

108
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:24,700
a few more settings to set our depth for

109
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:26,890
the drill and this is the drill part the

110
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,390
little blades that you see down there so

111
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,220
we'll go right over here and there's a

112
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,110
little hand crank there's a little crank

113
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,690
and there's a little dial right here and

114
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:38,380
we want to set it on eight by cranking

115
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,890
our little crank just like that so here

116
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,140
we go

117
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:45,610
cranking it cranking it right there to

118
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,440
the eight that's a little above the

119
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,120
eight yeah there we go looks good now

120
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,100
we'll be putting down some rye grain

121
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,960
right there's a rye grain and we want to

122
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,660
put the raw grain down we're gonna put

123
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,419
it on the number five at 15 okay and

124
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,490
that puts 15 pounds to the acre we want

125
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,500
to put the Rye grain and the rye grass

126
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,060
seed down because it's an annual and

127
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,310
it's going to come up really really fast

128
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,900
now we're on a hillside right here and

129
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,610
this hillside will wash so we want

130
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,320
something that's going to hit quick okay

131
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,640
hitting quick means it's going to grow

132
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,100
it's going to grow quick so it's going

133
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,930
to sprout a root within a day a day day

134
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,760
and a half that rye grain will and then

135
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,770
the ryegrass will follow about four days

136
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,680
later and then the fescue will follow

137
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,570
about seven to nine to twelve days later

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,640
so we'll get on our crank right here and

139
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:31,510
we'll start cranking until this guy gets

140
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:36,010
on the five okay it's set wide open

141
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:40,030
14 right now so actually something's

142
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:43,140
crunching in there Oh looks like we've

143
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,850
still got some wheat down in here so

144
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,160
that being said we'll find the setting

145
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,290
for wheat and we'll set it on what we

146
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,760
want the wheat to be ed now I was told

147
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,290
when I got this thing that it had some

148
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,910
wheat in it did I want the wheat taken

149
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,890
out and I said no no we'll just drill it

150
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,720
down in two so we'll take the wheat and

151
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,460
we'll run around and we'll drill with

152
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,440
the wheat just a little bit on some top

153
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,570
edges and some really like steep spots

154
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,790
now the setting for wheat and we want to

155
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:10,450
dump it out as fast as we can we'll

156
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:13,060
probably put the wheat at and let's just

157
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,590
dump it we'll put it up twelve okay

158
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,360
we're gonna get rid of that week now the

159
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,030
rear hopper is a little bit different

160
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,040
it's four clover seed if you look up in

161
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,080
there that's for a smaller seed and I'll

162
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,370
show you so the seeds are caught by this

163
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,260
little gear right here

164
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,330
and here's the adjuster you slide that

165
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,560
left to right and the gear slides left

166
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:35,380
to right so that's how much it's open

167
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,020
however much gear is exposed inside of

168
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,880
this tells you how much seed you're

169
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,010
gonna have down and we're gonna set it

170
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:46,270
we're gonna take it all the way to zero

171
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:48,940
and we're just gonna barely open it to

172
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,400
one right there is the one and it's a

173
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:54,220
dial right there okay we tighten up the

174
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,740
little wing nut okay now there's another

175
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,180
one we repeat this process right there

176
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,310
there's another one on the other side so

177
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,960
this is two separate compartments I

178
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,590
don't know how that rat got there but

179
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,060
that's gross

180
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,740
let's talk about the undercarriage let's

181
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,110
talk about what we have here okay so

182
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,790
this wheel helps to guide this wheel

183
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,460
right here rolls along the ground and

184
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,800
turns a shaft and that shaft goes up

185
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,590
through here and turns everything that's

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,160
moving in this machine and it also turns

187
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,630
an hour meter so right there is well

188
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,780
it's not an hour meter it's an acre

189
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,760
meter right there it'll tell you

190
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,590
ninety-eight revs per acre pretty cool

191
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,150
and all these little chains and doodads

192
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,860
I'm not going to go into total detail

193
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,260
but when it's moving it's moving

194
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,390
everything on here is moving these tubes

195
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,680
are what the seeds fall through and they

196
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,850
fall down through these tubes and they

197
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,860
fall down through these tubes it's

198
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,780
pretty cool this whole thing has a

199
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,350
suspension setup so it goes up and down

200
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,790
and follows the con

201
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,800
tour of the land so you take these

202
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,000
blades right here and they're rubbing

203
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,710
each other they're spinning freely

204
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,300
they're rubbing each other and on the

205
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,340
backside they're open we'll take you

206
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,320
around and show you that but they open

207
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,570
up the land they drop the seed in and

208
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,880
then this little wheel right here comes

209
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,650
in and mashes it down so that's a

210
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,420
no-till drill and there's the backside

211
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,060
okay that's what you see on the backside

212
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,070
so it opens the soil drops the seed and

213
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,990
then this little wheel presses it down

214
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,400
okay so the next step here is we're

215
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,990
gonna hop up and we're gonna start

216
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,430
dumping grass seed in first thing we're

217
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,380
gonna do is we're gonna load up this

218
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:26,420
platform right here with grass seed so

219
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:29,240
let's get busy doing that all right this

220
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,760
is our Kentucky 32 fescue it's an end of

221
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,870
fight free fescue for cattle pretty cool

222
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,419
now we're gonna go up here on the

223
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,669
platform and dump in our seed all right

224
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:40,760
up on the platform get our fiscal you up

225
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:43,360
there and basically we're gonna cut our

226
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,360
bags open

227
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:59,050
okay so guys this is Kentucky 32 fescue

228
00:08:55,819 --> 00:09:02,600
worried about $85 a bag on this there's

229
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,019
how many bags four bags in there right

230
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,990
now

231
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:09,410
that'll get us a good start and we have

232
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,970
one two three four seven more bags that

233
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,610
we're going to put out okay this will

234
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,149
all even out as we hit bumps and smooth

235
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,379
out okay pretty cool

236
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:20,899
now the next hopper we're going to use

237
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:22,339
is going to be our wheat hopper okay so

238
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,600
we're going to go ahead and burn through

239
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:25,279
that wheat we're going to take a little

240
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,810
bit ride a little bit around here and

241
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,939
get these spots that are in the middle

242
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,769
of the field first and get that wheat

243
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:32,269
out of there we're also going to load

244
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:34,069
the clover hopper and I'll show you the

245
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:37,519
clover hopper right here will close the

246
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:39,379
week and here's the clover hopper that's

247
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,449
what it looks like inside pretty simple

248
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,889
will load the clover hopper up and get

249
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,879
going with that now the clover cost one

250
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:45,560
hundred and twenty dollars for a

251
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,569
50-pound bag we're doing about

252
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,370
twenty-five to thirty acres here that'll

253
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:51,560
totally cover that you might be asking

254
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,100
hey why is he putting clover in with his

255
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,990
fescue

256
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,339
I'm putting clover in with my fescue for

257
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,470
the first few years to get it

258
00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:00,380
established well clover fixes nitrogen

259
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,269
to the soil fescue loves nitrogen we're

260
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,829
going to feed that grass seed and then

261
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:06,829
we'll probably go over it with a

262
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:09,829
herbicide to kill the broadleaf at some

263
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:11,689
point maybe we may go organic and we may

264
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:13,160
not use herbicides at all now the reason

265
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:15,980
that I'm putting the clover seed down is

266
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,810
because of a man named Joel Salatin he

267
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,279
wrote a book called salad bar beef I'll

268
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,740
post a link down below if you want to

269
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,300
raise your cows on a salad bar it's

270
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,189
pretty cool it's interesting book to

271
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,540
read and I went up to Polyface farm

272
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:28,009
where Joel's farm is if you've never

273
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,720
heard of him then I'm surprised you're

274
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:32,149
on this channel really really cool guy

275
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,699
nice place and what I noticed on his

276
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:36,620
farm was lots of clover in the fields

277
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:37,850
the fields were beautiful in green and I

278
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,230
think the element that was making them

279
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,939
beautiful in green was that clover

280
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:44,480
fixing that nitrogen that's a little bit

281
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:47,180
more difficult to get up here and put

282
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,120
your seed in here for your clover okay

283
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,629
and I'll show you the clover seed here

284
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,850
in a minute

285
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:56,240
the rye grass seed looks a whole lot

286
00:10:52,850 --> 00:11:00,080
like just grass the Rye grain is just a

287
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,420
little bit smaller than wheat like I

288
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,540
everybody knows what wheat looks like

289
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,370
but the clover is totally totally

290
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,520
different this is what the clover looks

291
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:14,690
like it's little beads so it's a little

292
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,760
bit more cumbersome to do the clover get

293
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,130
to be real careful these are separate

294
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,900
hoppers let's and make sure you get a

295
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:29,660
even amount in each hopper which we do

296
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:32,360
not have but at least we try so it's a

297
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,760
good idea to have a like a measuring cup

298
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,170
or a glass or a you know a cup or

299
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,130
something so you can even it out a

300
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,780
little bit and that's what we're gonna

301
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:42,770
do so we're gonna get to drilling okay

302
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:45,170
see you on the tractor guys be sure your

303
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:49,420
butt is always in the seat when you're

304
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,420
starting a tractor okay contact

305
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:57,209
okay guys what you're going to see here

306
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:59,619
is this hydraulic cylinder going up

307
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:01,809
taking a little bit of tension off okay

308
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:03,519
now the tension is off and we're going

309
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:05,470
to pull these pins right here well I

310
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,939
thought the tension was off we've got a

311
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,679
lever on the back of the tractor that

312
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:10,720
raises and lowers by controlling the

313
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:12,489
cylinder right here we're gonna raise it

314
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,699
up a little bit okay so we're going to

315
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:18,220
pull this pin right here out comes the

316
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:20,739
pin this little red guy kind of sits out

317
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,350
of the way and put our pin back in here

318
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:24,910
make sure it doesn't get gone and then

319
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,319
this whole cylinder will lower down to

320
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:31,389
the ground all right I'm gonna lower the

321
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:32,559
cylinder down now what we just did was

322
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:34,989
set these down on the ground

323
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,329
and set that wheel in motion that ATV

324
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:39,009
looking tire as that tire rolls it'll

325
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,249
start putting seed in the ground pretty

326
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,249
cool

327
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:58,499
[Applause]

[Music]

330
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,190
just a few more things that you need to

331
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,930
know when you're going around a sharp

332
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,340
turn with this thing you have to raise

333
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,230
it up and then when you start going

334
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,700
straight again you lower it back down so

335
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,680
you're constantly raising and lowering

336
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,180
and checking your hoppers I just check

337
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,460
to see if that wheat was gone it's not

338
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,050
quite gone yet but probably another 15

339
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,560
minutes of drilling and it'll all be

340
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,730
gone

341
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,370
I'm gonna go breathe a little bit of

342
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,600
dust have some fun so folks we got a lot

343
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,490
