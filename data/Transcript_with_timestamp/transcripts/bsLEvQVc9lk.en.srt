population. Precision agriculture finds its roots in the green revolution of the mid-20th

14
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:08,751
century when advanced farming techniques emerged.

15
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:12,180
However, it's in the digital age that precision

16
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,463
agriculture has truly taken flight, fueled by breakthroughs in data science, sensors, and

17
00:01:18,563 --> 00:01:25,490
automation. Today, precision agriculture employs
an array of technologies. Global positioning

18
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:32,716
system, geographic information systems, drones,
and satellite imagery enable precise mapping

19
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:39,762
and monitoring of fields. These tools empower
farmers to make data-driven decisions. Precision

20
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:45,587
agriculture comprises several key components.
These include site-specific crop management,

21
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:52,492
variable rate technology, automated machinery, and real-time monitoring by customizing practices

22
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:53,032
for each area of a field. Farmers can optimize inputs while minimizing waste.

23
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:59,322
The benefits 

24
00:01:59,482 --> 00:02:05,627
are abundant. Precision agriculture increases
crop yields, conserves resources like water

25
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:12,733
and fertilizers, reduces environmental harm,
and boosts profitability. The heart of precision

26
00:02:12,873 --> 00:02:19,438
agriculture is data, soil sensors, weather stations, and drones collect a plethora of information

27
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:26,067
on soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels, and more. This data provides valuable insights

28
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:32,711
