language Justice is a type of simultaneous interpretation that seeks to create spaces in which no one language is dominant spaces in which everyone can participate with the language of their heart so to achieve this objective we will be using zoom's interpretation feature what you will see in a couple of minutes is that I need a little button that looks like a globe will appear on the bottom bar of your screen on that same bar where you have the mic the video the chat and I love those other buttons it'll be towards your right hand when you see this button come up go ahead and click on it and select either English or Spanish as both the language that you will be listening into and speaking into if you're joining this meeting on a phone or on a tablet you will find the same options by clicking on the button with the three little dots on the lower right hand corner of your screen this button reads more a quick reminder for those of you that will be using English as their main language for today's meeting Spanish is 20 to 25 longer than English so please be aware of your speed and if there's any text that hasn't been translated in advance of the meetings in PowerPoints or elsewhere in the chat box wherever please um read out loud the main parts or we suggest that you read out loud most of the texts so that I can interpret it in the other language so that no one misses any any of the content if you're going to be using acronyms please uh spell them out the first couple of times to avoid any confusion among the listeners or myself if you have any questions or any issues whatsoever with this technology please let the whole group know by means of the chat box foreign thank you so much for having me here we can go ahead and start the interpretation channels yeah and I'd like to I see the first on my screen is Seraphina if you'd like to come off mute introduce ourselves we have Seraphina Aaron Reynolds Ellie and Aaron joining us as our guest speakers thank you Anna so glad to be here with you all good afternoon I'm Sarah Fina Lombardi I come from a long line of subsistence farmers and I'm still farming in Chimayo New Mexico with my family I used to be president of the Santa Fe Farmers Market helped found a local vegetable Growers Co-op and for the last 10 years I've been serving the New Mexico Aztec Association as our program director and I came to this work specifically to help our local indoorspano community's access uh nrcs and FSA programs that's the Farm Service Agency for FSA and nrcs's natural resource conservation service um I got a high tunnel through a nrcs program back in 2011 and since then I've been really happy to help others access these opportunities glad to be here and I'll pass it back to you on app foreign if you'd like to introduce yourself uh good afternoon and good morning everyone my name is Aaron Reynolds and I am a resource conservationist with the natural resources conservation service or nrcs that I'm going to use on a regular basis I am based out of Albuquerque New Mexico and I manage the equip program the Environmental Quality incentive program and our emergency Watershed Protection Program but my position is just specifically in the state of New Mexico and it doesn't vary in other states I have other counterparts in those states that do the exact same thing I do foreign er um and really amazing co-founder of an organization that I I draw a lot of inspiration from Ellie who's joining us from California hey everyone thanks so much for including me my name is Ellie iGo I join you from San Diego um and the land of the luisano um and or also known as the payomet and that we are fortunate to rent our land from and exciting to talk to you about today um today about nrcs and other programs that we've used to make our farm more resilient thank you Ellie and then uh who I work the closest with Aaron um is our water director in helping to kick off this Workshop series foreign yeah thanks Anna hi all nice to see you all thanks for being here as Anna said um my name's Aaron I am the water director for the national young Farmers Coalition uh so I'll be just sharing a little bit at the end about some other ways to plug in with our work and get more um information like this one but excited to be learning more about these nrcs programs thank you and without further Ado I am going to share just really quickly so you all can all see the Run of show today our agenda um we will dedicate a lot of time today to question and answers if you have questions along the way for speakers and it's relevant something that's top of Mind feel free to put those questions in the chat uh I will make sure if the speakers can address that question immediately that that is a question um that I'll keep as a log and we can come back to and during the question and answer part of our agenda um and I will also be helping our speakers keep track of time and keep us moving um so very quickly and then Seraphina is going to get us started um engaging all of you with a few questions are agenda is going to start with Seraphina and then we're gonna have a few presentation slide decks shared that will all be sent to you later um in an email so any of the information that you see today you will have access to later on we will also make sure to share our contact information that way if you have any questions that don't get addressed that you will have a way to follow up with each of us after um so today we've done our welcome and introductions um I'm going to go into why nrcs share a little about who who and what nrcs does uh here's some testimonials from Ellie um really give an overview of some of the existing programs in nrcs then we'll have time for question and answers and introduce our larger water campaign at the end and wrap up so without further Ado I am going to stop sharing my screen and hand the mic over to Serafina thank you Anna I got the mic so um I have to give a big shout out to all the New Mexico people out there I saw Miss Adriana I see some Samia people what's up Mexico's special we're all special on this call but in Mexico's extra special um so I'm really curious for all of us to get a little sense of what experience anyone here has had with any USDA programming in this bucket so the United States Department of Agriculture is the big department that the nrcs natural resource conservation service is under um and so I'm hoping folks can use the raise hand function which is in your reactions if you see a little smiley face emoji you can click on it and it'll give you a raised hand in the lower hand so we're going to go up and down a few times um but just wanted to jump in and say who here has registered signed up with the Farm Service Agency yeah let us know right on so that's the FSA Farm Service Agency it's an acronym that the need to know in the conversation we're having and they're the first step to being able to access nrcs programming if you don't sign up and get a farm and track number with the Farm Service Agency and there's a local office in not all counties but many counties and I'm sure we'll throw up in the chat a link to how to find those um you can apply for any nrcs programs and there's a whole other bucket of support and assistance that comes to the Farm Service Agency that we're not going to talk about but good for you everybody who signed up you can lower your hand awesome congratulations you have taken you've opened the door to Opportunity by doing so you've also ensured that your farm gets invited to be counted in the AG census which in New Mexico we're super undercounted as small world largely indoorspano farms and just like with the regular senses it can impact the resources that go to our regions so there's an equity aspect and um you know for this group beginning Farmers we want beginning farmers and ranchers counted too so I think you got my point on FSA here's the next question how many here have ever applied to nrcs it doesn't mean that you received a grant or it's not a grant you're not supposed to use that word cost assistance but okay right on my dogs are gonna go crazy now great timing neighbors dropping by and honking at me and that's all they're gonna get is dog bark one second foreign okay I have a taped to a room that's further away from the animals and visitors pardon the interruption that's part of just how we roll in our rural community stopping by for visits um so I see a bunch of you have applied it would be really cool if folks want to throw in the chat some of the practices that you've applied for and that's a term that nrcs uses to describe are you applying for irrigation practices High tunnel practices soil Health initiatives um Aaron's going to go way deeper into what some of those options are and the cost share and reimbursement type of on-farm improvements um right on high tunnel that's that was my it's a really good point of entrance to nrcs programs is the high tunnel work so right on and feel free to keep sharing those because I think it's really helpful from a peer-to-peer experience to see what other people are interested in and what potentially is working for them um and I think Aaron will touch on what some of the most popular programs are but if we let him know what we're really interested in he might be able to best speak to some of those programs too so um and that last question I'm going to ask well main last question so you can lower your hands if you put them up congratulations on applying um way to go and then the final one to have you received um a contract or implemented an nrcs program and so if you want to raise your hand if you've implemented one we can see who the the veterans are in the crowd yeah we got some folks with knowledge so you guys could be co-hosting with us up here and what's up CJ um explaining your experience uh right on good work and one of the things you all have probably found um and I know I experienced is that once you implement a practice and your neighbors find out about it you become an emissary for these programs and it just multiplies after that so my mentor I moved to New Mexico to work with Don Bustos who's a Visionary farmer in our region and he was like the first guy in the north to do high tunnels and then he did them and I did them and they're just like multiplied and we see it in our arid um high altitude climate as like a climate change adapting to seasonal change um strategy so we've had a lot of fun and I love the plastic part but we've had a lot of fun replicating that and creating a lot of farmer's market opportunities for folks um and then lastly if you haven't applied and you don't even know what the programs are but just you know what's the kind of support you're looking for on your farm that you think brought you to this Workshop you know what what is it that you have a need for um that you're hoping nrcs might be able to address and if you want to throw that in the chat oh my gosh it's so cool another dumb was still spin he says woohoo that's like his woohoo by the way if you know um and he changed my life I wouldn't even be here in this whole chapter of my life if it wasn't for Dom boosters total homage anyhow that's a longer story than we're here for today so um thank y'all for your input and your sharing and just like your engagement like you're doing it and way to show up to his Workshop just to get any tips and tricks you can um I want to talk briefly about why the New Mexico a second sensation and if you don't know where to secure that's a traditional irrigation canal that's Community run we're a local political government and I'll leave it at that um but we work with Farmers across the state to protect our water rights our cultural traditions and grow healthy food for our families and um we're doing this work really honoring and as a part of the legacy of Southern black farmers who stood up and addressed Injustice systemic discrimination within the USDA I'm the United States Department of Agriculture excluding a number of different um communities and in New Mexico that was largely indo-ispano farmers and ranchers in the south in the case the Pickford case that was settled in 2010 that was black Farmers across the country but especially in the South and so many communities including women at times have been historically marginalized marginalized and kept out of these programs and that funding and support for our farms and ranches was denied anime gets a grant from the USDA to do Outreach into historically underserved communities and nrcs has changed a lot even in the last decade or two and we have some awesome folks in our local County offices who look and experience more of what our communities look like as well as energy as being a national org so we have movement from across the country with folks who understand and are allied with local farms and ranches so for us it's part of our social justice mission to ensure that our communities who have in so many ways been historically disenfranchised feel like they have a seat at the table and have access to these programs so we do a lot of what we call hand-holding to get people their Farm Service um registration done and to apply for these programs and to some lesser degree Implement them we also we just went through historic and tragic Wildfire season in New Mexico and we know with climate change whether you know you're in the Midwest and you're getting flooding these climate disasters are coming and they're coming hard and they're hitting farmers and ranchers particularly hard um so we realized more than we ever had that ewp program emergency Watershed program Aaron referenced you you want to be a part of the system if you want to access a lot of the Disaster Assistance if you lose livestock you need to be registered to the Farm Service Agency for the livestock indemnification program and I could go on so registering with Farm Service Agency is an important step to being prepared for disasters um and for some degree of relief but also for some programs that can help mitigate and make us more resilient to disasters that come um and in general we think there's a lot of great strategies we're for anything that helps our local farms be more viable for us um growing food for Community is a very deep value and something we really still depend on in Northern New Mexico um but we also think the practice is nrcs office offers can be useful in climate change adaptation overall um I think the last few things that I would mention is that it is paperwork it is bureaucracy it's really none of our favorite things to be in the system and have to kind of follow um the specs um that are exterior to us but I really encourage you all to explore the offerings to reach out to your local County offices both of the Farm Service Agency and the nrcs in order to establish relationships create a site visit that's the number one after you do FSA it's all about getting a site visit so you can learn more about what might work on your farm your local nrcs rep is an ally and someone who's there to give you technical assistance whether or not you want to apply for any programs to get feedback to get support um and so we just really encourage everyone to know the ins and outs of a contract before they're signing it I have lots of thoughts on that um and you know then just go ahead and once you feel confident jump into feet first but I think one of the best things is connecting with folks locally who've done a similar program and gaining lessons learned from them um so with that I just wish all of you a bountiful happy safe growing season that you find all the resources that you need and if you are a farmer a Rancher um often a sick in New Mexico the anime A is here to provide more detailed technical assistance I'm looking forward to the rest of the meeting and potentially supporting with any questions you all have and now you've seen my bathroom while we're at it too foreign if you could please put your contact information in the chat um we also have a New Mexico nrcs staff here Aaron who's going to share a little more for those of you who may not be as familiar with who the natural resources conservation Services is and what they do all righty thank you so I'll go ahead and share my screen all right well uh again good morning good afternoon everybody um again my name is Aaron Reynolds and I am a resource conservationist with the natural resource conservation Service uh based out of Albuquerque for this first portion that I'm going to present on it's mainly going to be around what nrcs is and what our two major programs we like to see I know there's been a lot of mentioned of the ewp or the emergency Watershed Protection Program and um at the end of the presentation I can mention what that program is because it is significantly different than any of our other programs that we offer to people and it's mainly based around natural disasters um fires and floods and things of that nature that pose a threat to human life and property but at this point in time I'm not going to go too much into depth on it so my contact information is on the slides and these slides will be shared with everyone but I can also put my contact information in the chat for people um so um just giving a brief introduction about myself um I've been with the agency going on 12 years now I've actually worked in multiple States so I'm originally from Wisconsin where I grew up on a small farm and started within RCS in the midwest then I actually moved to Colorado and I worked out on the Eastern Plains on more conventional agricultural operations and then I moved to New Mexico where I eventually ended up in Albuquerque as a resource conservationist or program manager so uh for those who don't know nrcs is an agency within the United States Department of Agriculture so this is a federal agency and um very commonly we work with a lot of conservation districts locally in areas and other organizations that assist farmers and ranchers to improve their operations but nrcs or the natural resources conservation service provides landowners with technical assistance and a vice advice for their land specifically and one of the things I always like to mention to nrcs staff and also the landowners is that those local landowners know their land better than anybody else you know we just come in and try to help them improve their Landing continue what they're trying to achieve on that land so nrcs provides common technical goal assistance in the area will assess resource resources and then we'll also come in with practice design and resource monitoring all of this is done throughout the what we call the conservation planning process and um you know it's a very fluid motion and it changes depending on what the needs of that landowner are so that's just briefly where nrcs comes in is that we're a scientific scientific and Technical based agency that will assist uh you know landowners and again I'll get it more into the details of who's eligible and what are the requirements for our programs but there is financial assistance to implement a lot of these programs so um for those who don't know um nrcs used to be called The Soil Conservation service and the roots of nrcs is um based in the 1930s and the Dust Bowl so if people um can recall back to their history courses the Dust Bowl was a time in American history where there was a lot of tillage occurring and soil in the air and um you know the president at that time so FDR actually saw the need to implement conservation Nationwide and thus that's how nrcs was born um nrcs has evolved and I should say changed tremendously in recent years and now our Focus has expanded to um soil water air plant and animals there are soil resource concerns so um it's a much different agency and it's a much broader agency than what it used to be um so as mentioned I'm gonna the two cost share programs that we have through nrcs are the equip program and CSP so in simple terms um because we don't have enough time to go in depth on all these programs so I'm just going to give a brief summary of what each one of these programs are and then we can build from there so the first program that I'm going to mention is the Environmental Quality incentive program and uh we call it short we call it equip as its acronym and it provides Technical and financial assistance to producers to address a natural resource concerns deliver environmental benefits through conservation practices to protect soil water air and other natural resources concerns and in simple terms the way you look at this is equip treat specific concerns and I'm going to provide a few scenarios of how equip is used and then eventually our um guest presenter that has actually implemented this can describe how they installed these practices so as mentioned eqip is very specific you have one resource concern that you're trying to treat so um one of the common uh comments that I saw was a lot of people utilize them for high tunnels and when high tunnels are installed which um I guess real briefly what a high tunnel is a high tunnel is a structure that is covered in plastic that extends your growing season so you can start for example your cool season crops earlier or get some of those warm season crops to go a little later depending on what you need them so through eqip um you could receive cost share on the high tunnel itself the irrigation inside that high tunnel there are some specific requirements on the irrigation and what's needed to meet the install and irrigation but you could have the irrigation you could have nutrient management which is testing your soil and get an idea of you know how many how much of nutrients do I need in my soil to achieve my desired yield goal and then also um there's things like Pest Management to manage disease and other pests that could damage you and then also one called irrigation Water Management to better manage your water usage on your property and you know that's just one specific example of how equip could be used for this um you know eventually I'll talk about some of the land uses that equip could be used on you know because it can range from forestry can range from rangeland pasture crop land so there's a it's a variable program that gives you a lot of flexibility depending on what your specific needs are for this program um then the next program I'm going to mention and this isn't one of the programs I manage specifically but it's called our conservation stewardship program and simply put the conservation stewardship program the goal of the program is to build on good conservation that you're already doing so you're far if you're already testing your soil if you're already monitoring your water it assists those producers to take it to a Next Level and do more advanced forms of those conservation systems and specifically on the CSP program that makes it unique is in order to be eligible for CSP um you have to sign up for five years at one time equip doesn't have that requirement equip can be a one and done up to 10 years to get your work done but you won't be tied into the program through equip um and then that's going to be just a pretty good summary of the programs um eventually I will talk about some of the eligibility of the programs and what all goes into um actually signing up so I'll go ahead and hand it off to the next presenter all right well I'm just gonna jump in then um and say hello to everybody I think I'm next is that right um all right so my name is Ellie for those of you that weren't on the call yet um I'm from solidarity farm and um I am going to share my screen so that you guys can see some pictures of um what we do [Music] all right so what I'm excited to talk to you today is is how we've leveraged nrcs and combined it with other resources to make it really work for our farm um and just want to start by saying that you know solidarity Farm is a modest sized Farm um we prefer we produce um Diversified fruits and vegetables and we collaborate with our neighbors um through a small farm Distribution Company called food shed um and you know we um well we Farm probably at any given time about five out of those 10 acres and we've been doing it for about 10 years um so I'm going to start just by telling you guys a story about a really important year which was 2017. um we you know had just really gotten our feet under us and had had crops in the ground and we're selling commercially and our kids were involved on the farm um and we had a heat event that was about 122 degrees following a winter of severe freezing and um we understood that if we didn't get serious about um really investing in our soil and figuring out how to be more resilient that we were not going um to be able to continue farming and we really wanted our kids to to see that you know you can adapt to challenges um and that you have to adapt in order in order to survive so that was really our our impetus and so we came up with these four goals um and I also really quick want to give a shout out about that time um we had a um a intern or an apprentice come to stay on the farm named Andy Williamson who's on the call today um who really pushed us also to to try out some of these practices so um I just want to acknowledge Him and how important he was to us um but we decided that if we wanted to keep farming we really need to needed to invest in four things right we needed to keep our soil covered we needed to improve water delivery efficiency we needed to reduce evaporation that was caused by wind and we needed to buffer against cold and heat events with better infrastructure and and that's a picture of the barn that was toppled by the winds that we get these winds called Santa anas out in in San Diego and so um we really you know it was that same year that that Barn fell down um and so just sharing that the impacts um that pushed us were pretty severe I realize I'm talking too quickly I'm going to slow down for interpretation um and so in our need in our desire to address these four um these four issues we looked around for allies and resources um and obviously today we're gonna um we're talking about nrcs um but I just want to acknowledge that there were three other resources that we we really relied on one is called the healthy soils program um which is a California state program uh zero food print which is a private Foundation that leverages money for um through restaurants um for regenerative agriculture and then the coastal conservancy and I just want to point out that you know we need as Farmers we need to to leverage all of these resources and find out what's happening in our area because there really isn't a one-size-fit-all program um that can help us get the job done so here are the practices that we have implemented with an nrcs conservation equip Grant we have been able to put in hedgerows and wind breaks and we've improved our irrigation efficiency so we used a lot of lay flat to move the water all the way across our farm and we were able within our CS funds to put those pipes underground and get you know um new new Outlets closer to the fields that we were working in um and uh two high tunnels and in in our first round of equip um our healthy soils Grant um from California Department of food and agriculture let us address cover cropping and reducing tillage on our farm zero food print brought in the compost that we needed and the coastal Conservancy um helped us to or supported our perennial some of our perennial transition and allowed us to use native more drought tolerance seed in our cover crop which was really important to Southern California but wasn't something that was affordable given that the nrcs practice really covered you know cheaper seed like barley foreign so some of the challenges um to consider words of wisdom for things that we learned um as short-term renters our landlords had to agree to facilitate this process um we were really grateful that our landlords saw the benefit and they LED on this um we found that nrcs was busy our local office was busy and we had to be persistent to get our first meeting um and this is the part that I think is really important for smaller scale farms and I I saw in the chat when we were getting started that people are already kind of aware of this but um you know a lot of these programs are cost reimbursement and so it requires really thoughtful planning and partnership um to really think about how you're gonna Fork out the money for these practices and then wait for reimbursement um and I thought it was really interesting that nrcs could not tell us how much something might cost to actually Implement in our area and they really could only tell us what the reimbursement rate was um and so that was a little intimidating um because you know you're getting into it Without Really knowing what how expensive everything's going to be so do your homework and build a budget for yourself and don't assume that the cost is actually going to cover what you need for your area and the other thing is that your local nrcs office may not have the expertise that you need in-house so we live in an area that's very um it's full of citrus and avocado farmers and so our local technical advisors are really great at Citrus and avocado but they don't have a lot of knowledge about row crops and so you need to Advocate that your nrcs folks reach outside of their comfort zone and and to other Ally you know other staff in nrcs who have that expertise and then finally you need to account for specialized equipment needs as you apply for the practice so something like if you're putting in cover crop and you're reducing tillage you might need access to a no-till seed drill um but you you know you don't want to or can't afford to go out and buy one just for the practice right or you might need to rent scaffolding to be able to put up your high tunnel or you might need a mulch spreader um that that you don't quite have yet so really think about what you actually need to implement and if it's even available in your area so ways to overcome some of these barriers I do want to say that bringing you know advocating and bringing that nrcs person out early um and then trusting the process um is is really important um don't do too much homework before you actually bring them out to your farm um you can ask a resource Conservation District or other ta providers in your area to connect you with a mentor another farmer who's done this work before um I think is really would be really really helpful and advised um and you can advocate for overlapping your practices so the field Prep Plus the irrigation plus the planting so that you can maximize the reimbursement um and make sure you can actually cover your costs um and this one I think is really important um to overcome that barrier of cost reimbursement you can find a lending partner that understands the nrcs program so I noticed someone was here from farmlink today California farmlink or even the Farm Service Agency if you have an NRC if you have a nrcs equip contract you should be able to get a loan right to match that contract and then when you get paid back by nrcs you could use that money to pay back the loan now the terms and the length and all that is something to consider but it could be a really great opportunity to build your credit and to and to make those two sort of programs mesh together and then finally you can look for contractors um that can that you can pay with nrcs funds to help you install the practice so for example this is a picture um of a gentleman from Fresno so Fresno's Way North in California we had to pay him to drive his no-till seed drill all the way down because one didn't exist to do our cover cropping practice in San Diego um but he had the expertise and he just busted it out and it actually ended up being more affordable than if we had tried to figure out how to broadcast it or do it ourselves so definitely look for people who can help you with the practices um because we're farmers and and really implementing this practice these practices is all about our bottom line um I wanted to share some of the impact that this programs have had for us um we have definitely seen a reduction in losses during extreme weather events um because of the practices that we've implemented we've seen our soil organic matter increase from about the you know the normal threshold which is about one percent to seven percent in some of the areas that we've really been applying these soil building techniques um that additional soil organic matter has a huge impact um on reducing our water bill and um the hedgerows also have had a big impact in reducing the wind that's directly hitting the beds that are behind them and that also has an impact on reducing our summer water bill we've also seen improved pollination rates and yields near the hedgerows although we're just really starting to be able to monitor that as our hedgers are getting bigger um and we've seen this is a big one we've seen improved infiltration and reduced flooding during Heavy Rain events and we've seen Financial gains from the season extension that our high tunnels bring that's really a huge one and why I think Kai tunnels are the most popular or one of the most popular nrcs practices and then finally you know really investing into bringing this diversity onto our farm gives us an opportunity to bring education and other types of activities onto the farm so this is an herbalism class for kids um and and just wanted to kind of share that um there are sort of benefits outside of just the economic ones um to your community so I'll close with that this is my contact information um and happy to you know kind of connect and answer any questions you all might have wow congratulations those are some really huge successes to uplift um and more specifically wanted to go into a few of those programs some that solidarity Farms using others that you've heard mentioned um and also if you're having any trouble keeping track of the different acronyms being thrown around I did post in the chat uh key uh acronym sheet as well as steps for receiving USDA assistance and then we're going to pass it back to Aaron to to go into more specifics great thank you and Ella that was great to hear that story and hear the local benefits and your goals being met on that operation um real quick before I get into the presentation um I'm a big fan of soil health I like hearing that you're implementing soil health and helping the system just reach its natural state because our soil is so unhealthy at this point so that's great to hear you're you know reaching for those goals to improve your soil which ultimately is going to make your pocketbook a lot bigger as well so um that's very great to hear so um I'll bring up my slides again um and I Ellie was talking about the high tunnels this was a high tunnel I actually worked on in New Mexico um in Southwest in the Gila that we installed for him and you can see the benefit this is having for him specifically so um what I'm gonna review today is I'm going to briefly review the application process through nrcs there is a link that does go a bit more in depth that you can follow that's been posted in the chat and it just explains all these different sections from the planning application eligibility ranking and then the implementation as well and I'll mention a little bit about the implementation towards the end of this presentation as well and how the reimbursement program works and some of the things I like to recommend to a lot of the farmers to implement the practices and not go Belly Up and afford to do the good the good conservation work as well um so as mentioned um almost every county has an nrcs office in there but there are going to be a few scenarios where there's not an office there and with how an RCS programs work it's very personal and it's based on your operation so we need to go out to your operation really to help you you know we can talk to you at our desk and say here's what we think you need but we ultimately can't make that decision until we go out to your specific Farm Ranch or you know Forest stand so if you're unsure of where your office is located you can follow that link to find it you can just match it to what county you're located in and go from there once you find where your office is located you can then fill out a uh see what we call a CPA 1200 or for simple purposes it's our application that you can fill out and you can actually go into the office and fill it in at the office and we can make sure we can kind of line you up make recommendations of you know how who you need to go and see and where you would need to go and one thing nrcs did just Implement recently is we now do have applications and other contract documentation in multiple language so um you know in most cases the staff will hand a application in English but if you are looking for another language just let that local field staff know and they can get you an application in another language and there's numerous I want to say it's I don't even know how many total languages but there are a lot of languages that the application forms are offered in now after that um if you haven't already you I guess it's it's up to you how you you would want to proceed um you can come to our office at any time and we can take an application but one thing we will need from you is we will need you to go to the Farm Service Agency so FSA and register with them and uh if you ever have any issues on that paperwork you can either go to them or we can help you fill out a lot of that information because it can be a little complicated and you know there is a lot of red tape but it is necessary and all the information um that FSA collects or nrcs collects we don't share with anyone we um view that as very important information and it's very personal so when you apply you don't need to worry about um any identity theft or anything like that because we will protect your information and we're not going to share it with anyone else around the country so after you go through that process of filling in an application you know as Ellie mentioned um it's good to get an RCS out there right away and um then we can go out to your property we can walk around with you we can identify what your specific concerns are and we can also identify additional concerns as well um you know as I mentioned some of the resource concerns we're going to be looking at Are soil water air plant and animal and obviously we go a lot more in depth than that um as elliemann as Ellie was talking you know for soil we do stuff with soil Health but if it's water we'll do work with water quantity water quality things of that nature and real quick just taking a step back one thing I did want to mention is we do take applications year-round we do have set deadlines that are established every year but regardless of a time you can come into our own office and submit an application for for possible funding and we'll just roll you into when the next sign up occurs and work with with you in that ranking process so never hesitate to submit an application for nrcs programs you know our door is always open um so going into the programs and these are true with any of our programs uh whether it be equip or CSP um who is eligible to apply for our programs as you can see on the screen it varies from an individual just based on your social security number it could be a legal entity if you're in a corporation or a partnership it could be a joint operation we do help the tribes if they wish to sign up there are some different rules and um in some areas I know in New Mexico this is a very big deal our water management entities are very influential and historic in the state of New Mexico and simply put a water management entity is a governing body that has jurisdiction over water usage and they can actually enter into a contract with an RCS to improve water distribution for their property so it could actually impact most multiple people so just keep in mind that a sakias and irrigation districts are eligible for our funding but in most cases it's either going to be your individual visual or legal entity another important aspect of our programs is control of land and specifically when it comes to control of land nrcs can enter into a contract with one or more participants that have control of the offered land and when we talk control of land it doesn't necessarily mean you have to own that land but you can also be renting that land and then also depending on how you're planning your contract you don't have to show control for the entire length of the contract so if you're in a year-to-year lease like a lot of renters are we you can update that at least every year and still be eligible for Contracting so don't feel like you wouldn't be eligible if you don't own the land or you don't have you know a five-year lease that doesn't matter we look at control of land every single year so just remember that you know it can be at least you know at least rent or a permit and when I say permits that's relating to federal land whether it be BLM Bia or I should say Bureau of Land Management Bureau of Indian Affairs um those Acres can be included as well um next I'm talking about land types specifically and when I say land types it's pretty much how the land is used and just to give you an idea on a some of the eligible land types that nrcs will contract on is we do have crop land which can either be rural like in the photo on the right on the top or it can be just your conventional lag as on the right and uh I know I saw a few mentions of um silviculture and trees and we do lump in that type of land use into the crop fund pool so there is some flexibility when it comes to that a few of the other eligible land uses are pasture which is irrigated and grazed by livestock rangeland which is grazed by livestock which is a term used in the western USA for where the cattle Grays we do have Forest industrial or non-industrial and when we say forest it was historically Forest land and that's where we do a lot of fire management practices and even some grazing practices if it's grazed force and then also Association Associated Agland and farmsteads so after we identify that you are eligible for our programs we do go into a ranking process sadly not everybody is funded in the program but there is a set amount of dollars set aside for those practices so I won't go in depth because there's a few other things I want to review um later on and specifically it's on what we call historically underserved applications and when we use this term it's members of groups have been historically underserved or have been subject to discrimination in federal programs so it was actually set dollars for these producers and it's actually at a higher cost share rate as well and a socially disadvantaged individual um or entity is a member excuse me individual or industry who is a member of a socially disadvantaged group socially disadvantaged groups consist of the following so American Indians are Alaskan native Asians black or African-Americans native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders and Hispanics um sadly um just being female alone doesn't qualify for socially disadvantaged these are just rules that were set in policy but it's still important to know if you qualify for any of these um another common one that I think we're going to see happening more often with Urban agriculture is uh beginning Farmers so someone who hasn't farmed a ranch for uh more than 10 years if you qualify for that you actually receive a higher payment rate than you would normally and then the veteran farmer and Rancher is just a beginning farmer that has veteran status and then the last one is the limited resource farmer Rancher and um with director indirect gross sales not more than the current index value in each of the previous two years and who has a total household income at or below the National Poverty Level level for family a four or less than 50 percent of the county median household income in each of the previous two years so those are just some of the terms that um you know it's important that you guys remember that you're eligible for those programs or eligible for those definitions um and then I guess what we can do is I did provide a few links as mentioned and if people have specific questions about um the payment process I can cover that uh later on just so we can keep things rolling along so at that um that's just a very fast rundown of our programs yes thank you so much Aaron and I I appreciate you also keeping it brief I know that that is a lot of information and I'm sure for the audience to receive as well and for our interpreter um who's asked us in the chat um as we right now enter into the question and answer part of this Workshop this is really for you all who've joined us taking time out of your day um if you have questions directly for some of our speakers or more generalized questions what you could do is raise your hand and then come off mute um by you know the the first to to raise their hands and we'll make sure to get through everyone also if you'd like to you're more than welcome to put your question in the chat um and my friends and our co-presentative Serafina is gonna help me keep track of all of the different questions um I do see one right now and uh just to remind ourselves when we ask these questions if we can keep a conversational piece for interpretation uh that way some of these questions you may have others who are joining on our Spanish Channel or who will be watching the recording recording later can also keep track thank you all I do see um adiola and maybe you could say how you pronounce your name I definitely want to say it right yeah thank you guys for this Workshop um you pronounced it correctly adiola is my name um and my question is um in regards to the last speaker if he could answer this question I have applied for I don't know if you guys can answer this question but I've applied for um an equip program in my state and I followed all the procedures that you mentioned however and I actually applied before the deadline for my particular State maybe a few days before because that was when I learned about it but I haven't heard anything back from them what would you suggest that will be my next steps because I've reached out to the person that was in my that was my contact uh twice she did reply me once but I have yet to hear back from her so I wanted to find out what should be my next steps should I contact her again or should I go up to the office or what should I do yeah so in the and thanks for your question so in that scenario I know it can be frustrating when they haven't um responded back to you I what you need to do is kind of multi you kind of need to be a little bit of persistent a bit of thorn in our side if we're not responding to you I would show up at the office I'd call us you know if you don't even get anywhere there if you use that locator that was mentioned you can actually look at um contacting people higher up the chain as well if you do find that that field office isn't responding to you I mean ideally they should uh be responding to you as soon as possible but I would start becoming a bit of a squeaky wheel and making sure you're being heard and um you know again it can get complicated for a lot of our staff when it's continuous sign up because they just want to focus on here's what I'm working on at this point in time but in reality we need to be um consistently taking applications and consistently how helping people thank you so much I just didn't want to seem like a nuisance but I've heard from you and I've also heard from Ellie thanks Ellie for your response kind of just one thing I'd add is that it's hard I know in New Mexico a lot of our offices are understaffed and there's like so and I work in an understaffed office so not nrcs but I feel for staff who's overwhelmed and we have to get responses but just you know because we're often friends with our local folks in the offices it reminds us like Linda why aren't you going to talk to us we recently found out there was like a multiple month turnaround to get a Farm Service number which in my mind is like a week turn around kind of thing um and then also I think Aaron it can be helpful now like depending on how things work in your state but it can be a couple months between when you put in an application their batching period And when they're actually deciding who they're offering contracts to so asking the office their timeline can help you have more clear expectations of when they're actually blowing you off or they just are like we have no information and I would just say you know echoing it's hard it's hard patience persistence game y'all got this yeah and to add to that um as well um oh I lost my train of thought you can go ahead sorry whoever had questions next well could I just jump in here really quick um I just want to say I super appreciate that um everyone's being so straightforward about what we have to do but um I I also just want to lift this up as a national policy issue um and that the the amount of gatekeeping on funding um is is hugely problematic and we need to untie the hands of our our friends at these offices um so that they can push funding out quicker um and we have an opportunity maybe on the farm bill or just any chance that we have I think to get in front of decision makers um we need to be talking about this because we shouldn't have to go into the office we shouldn't have to wait months and months like we're trying to Steward land and solve climate and address climate change and it we can't take excuses that people are just too busy um especially when you're a farmer someone giving you that is that excuse like falls on pretty like closed ears so like I said I appreciate Aaron and you know Sarah Gina being so honest but um yeah and and like Hector says the funding's there we just have to like make it flow yeah and just to speak to that as well we the field staff can only control so much when it gets to them and what my comment was going to be is timelines deadlines and all that information vary from state to state so you really need to be in contact with your local state but in general we post all of our information online of when our ranking deadline is so you can always go to the nrcs State website and see when those deadlines are and um from there um it also established application deadlines ranking deadlines and it gives you all that information so we have to post those deadlines you know 30 days prior to when they occur so at the same time as nrcs needs to help um some of the people applying need to be on the spot as well and understand what they're applying for and have all their Affairs in order so if information is missing that slows us down but um definitely you know we can only control so much of where money is spent and where it isn't and for people that feel like they're not getting funded um you really need to talk to your local work groups so a lot of those conservation districts that help nrcs establish where our dollars are spent so it's not as simple as we can just say oh you want to put in a high tunnel here's some money you know we do have to go through a process and sadly we're not able to establish those process processes um to get you funding but um I know field staff isn't intentionally trying to ignore you or not treat your concerns but um please continue just to work with your local field staff and if it does go on silent years um you know eventually start looking at some of the highers higher up in the states and your State office employees and we'll also share a little more um at the end of this presentation our efforts to um really influence and push the nrcf's offices I did want to address and I heard it come up in that question and some of the responses I want to um before going to the person with their hand raised I think these questions could be answered maybe as you know they're along the similar line of thought um how often is funding made available and if you don't get funded when you apply are you able to the following year and then I guess along with that um Hector asked uh where do you find the grant cycles for all of the programs um and that way people can apply within those cycles and I think you know Aaron you partly addressed this in sharing that it really is State specific um but if you could speak to ways that people can keep track of that in um so that they don't miss the application and Grant Cycles um and I think also along with that um how long do you have to be established to be able to apply for those okay yep so I'll just go right down the list of the comments of how often is funding made available so it really depends but in general we do funding applications individually for each program so it does happen every single year now in the scenario you don't rank high enough to get the funding um you will be sent a letter asking would you like to defer your application into the next year so if you do choose to defer that application it will be rolled over into the following year but what I would encourage you if you're constantly applying and not getting funding talk to your field staff about treating additional or additional resource concerns that they found on your property because in general the more resource concerns you treat the higher likelihood you have to be funded so if you're uh just coming in every year saying all I want is a high tunnel I don't want anything else you're you're not going to have as high of options to get funding if you were planning a cover crop to treat soil health or if you're doing pollinator habitat you're treating more resource concerns so definitely be flexible in what you're willing to do and you know if you really need to get funded you might have to treat those additional resource concerns as well and then going into the next um question was on the grant Cycles um we have a continuous sign up as I mentioned so bring your application to the office right away uh when you want to apply for our programs and then if you are curious about when our deadlines are I encourage you to link to your local State nrcs website where we are required to post when our deadlines are it's a federal law that we let everyone know when those occur and um you know they're publicly seen so when it comes to um officially established we don't have any requirements on how long you have to be in operation in order to be eligible for our programs um regardless of type of operation the size of your operation location or the overall income of your operation that doesn't matter as long as you fill out our application you go and get eligible with the FSA you will be able to apply for our programs now specifically when it starts getting into uh work with irrigation we do have to identify irrigation history and you would have to have irrigated those um acres for two out of the last five years and specifically with that comment as well when it comes to cropland is it has to be active cropland it can't be just grassland that you're going to farm you need to be actively farming that land at the time you apply and then you'd be eligible for our cropland practices so I'm just going to emphasize what Aaron said If you're trying to break fallow ground and you want nrcs practices on that land you do that first and maybe wait a year so when they come to the site visit they're like yeah this looks like agriculture as opposed to it looks like foul land I want help on yeah yeah and to go in depth we can't convert land to something else that it isn't you know we do have set guidelines and we're not trying to you know put more acres into production because just um production by itself isn't a resource concern we treat foreign thank you and we have a we have a hand raise if you want to come off mute hi this is chido I'm the equity program manager from California Association of rcds I oh I'm located in San Jose in California Santa Clara County and in our County we have 130 Asian farmers in most of those Asian farmers the Chinese Farmers Japanese Farmers Korea farmers and Vietnamese farmers and we are talking about a group of people that is really isolated they don't speak any English and they produce they produce and then sell to the local Asian stores so there is no English needed for them to produce and successful for the farm they have never heard about anas yes they don't know those wonderful progress programs exists so for the past three years I was working as an extension specialist and I introduced this equip program to them and all of them are so interested and they want to apply so I'm asking here does nrcs have a kind of a brochure or kind of flyer for different kind of problems and the eligibility in different languages so that I can send in this information to those group to the group of Growers instead of me talking to them individually because I have my full-time job and I am too busy to talk to each farmers so and thanks for your questions nrcs does perform a lot of Outreach in those communities um you know actually on another leadership project I'm working on we are looking at ways to improve Outreach to a lot of those communities whether it be on the radio or specifically go into their meetings what I would encourage yourself to do is reach out to the local field staff and have them come and give a presentation at you know I'm meeting you organized to reach those producers because for nrcs it's very hard to reduce or reach out to a lot of the people um you know because we're so busy with uh programs and other technical assistance so work with your local staff to put on events and RCS can host events and we can gear it towards specific communities as well to improve that Outreach because I would agree and RCS does need to do a better job um you know letting people know that we're here and that we can help anyone yeah you know regardless of where they're at or who they are okay thank you Aaron for your uh answer and I have a small little answer uh question tip are those funding that the Growers receiving do they have to pay tax yes they do technically they do got it got it yeah and real quick on that comment as well nrcs programs when it comes to equip we cost share um the cost share is meant to only be a 75 cost share so keep in mind that when people apply for nrcs programs we're not necessarily going to pay for everything included we're only going to pay for a portion of that cost so it is important that um you're aware and who's ever applying is aware that there might be some monetary requirement on whoever is applying you guys have so many good questions and you're going to go so far with this I'm going to add One Word of Wisdom I was on Medicaid when I first applied and I had to really calculate like will this 1099 mess up my eligibility so I can stay on Medicaid no it didn't because that's how we're living at that point but for anyone who's you know a part of one of those programs you want to really Eyes Wide Open is my Mike um General phrase on how to approach all of this because there's so many benefits you just want to make sure um there's you don't get tripped up once you sign that contract you want to be really ready and know you can implement it because if you can't there can be penalties and challenges but overall we're hoping everyone finds a way to have a positive experience and especially pre appreciate everyone who's getting this out to communities who don't have as much access so amazing questions um we're going to move on to the next segment of our agenda but I just want to say it's been really fun to visit with all of you and I'm I'm hoping everyone gets into all the programs and gets all the support that they hope for and need Anna I'll pass it to you yes and I keep inviting inviting questions that we will have again all of the speakers put their contact information in the chat especially if you have I can hear a lot of questions geared toward Aaron I would really also encourage you to look up and reach out to your local nrcs office and feel free as well to reach out to myself um and our water director Aaron who's going to be sharing a little of um how we are working to shift and shift the needle and see changes um in nrcs programming and alongside the farm bill in USDA um so Aaron if you want to kick us off yeah thanks Anna and thanks so much to Serafina and Aaron and Ellie for being here to share about these programs um like Anna said I'm just gonna be talking a little bit about the work that National young Farmers Coalition is doing um on nrcs programs on water and climate issues so I'm just gonna share a little bit about what we do we do have a water campaign called generations for water at National Farmers coalition before I go into that just wanted to share a little bit for those of you who may not be too familiar with national young Farmers Coalition just who we are and what we do we are a Grassroots network of over 200 000 Farmers ranchers uh supporters Advocates and we are working to shift power and change policy to more equitably we resource the new generation of working farmers and we envision a just future where farming is free of racial violence accessible to communities oriented towards environmental well-being and connected with health over profit so that's just a little bit about the work that we're doing at nationally on Farmers Coalition it includes our water work we also work on land access climate economic Justice student loan debt so if you're interested in getting involved in some of those other campaigns we can plug you into those as well but I am going to focus uh just a bit on our water work which is most connected with these nrcs programs we believe that water systems should foster vibrant agricultural communities healthy ecosystems and water Justice for indigenous communities and other communities of color so when we're looking at public policy we want public policy that's going to be protecting water for agriculture supporting on-farm conservation I can get Serve and Protect our Clean Water Resources programs like equip that Aaron has been talking about and ensuring access to clean drinking water so we do this in a number of ways water issues can be Super Hyper local it can be really International it's Global well we hear a lot the challenges that young farmers are facing are related to Drought flooding and water quality issues so we work on policy but we know that can't be solved through federal policy alone so we also work to build farmer leadership we put on educational events like this and foreign Partnerships to support Farmers to be leaders in water policy and conservations so I just want to tell you a little bit about what that looks like in practice for our farmer leadership work we run Fellowship programs I saw a few of our water fellows on here to do more in-depth training on water issues at the state and federal level and support young farmers and ranchers and bike farmers and ranchers to not just learn about these issues but step into leadership positions where they can be decision makers on our water policy we do educational workshops like this one we've got another one coming up next week that I'll talk a little bit more about so if you just want some information on what are the resources available to you we'll be keeping in touch about different educational workshops that we have going on and then we do a lot of policy work right now we're focused on the farm bill I think Ellie mentioned that a little bit the farm bill is kind of the big big federal policy piece on food and farm programs that's happening this year Congress is starting to rewrite that so we're going to be working a lot on Farm Bill advocacy and then we also work on access and accountability to USDA so I heard a little bit of feedback here on how accessing those nrcs programs have been going so we can help with that help hold USDA and nrcs accountable to the commitments that they've made and provide feedback on how those programs are working for young farmers um so here are some ways that you can stay in touch with us um this is our first Workshop in a short Series this um this spring on how to use federal resources um to support conservation and also manage risk when it comes to Drought floods freezes we're going to be talking more about those disaster programs next week um Anna I think he's gonna throw in the chat the registration for that next Workshop if you're interested in um Federal programs that can help you support you if there's a disaster and then we're going to be putting on our third workshop on world water day that'll be more celebratory connecting networking and getting to know you all a little bit more in March for World water day another way to stay um involved with us and is touch is work with us to connect with your local and state nrcs leaders Aaron mentioned you can connect with your field staff you can connect with staff at the state level or federal level too so if you have feedback that you want to provide on how those programs are going let us know and we're happy to help you make those connections um we've got a few other resources we have a national survey report that has more information on young Farmers across the country the water challenges that they're facing and how they're addressing those so check out our survey report you can also share your own story and if you don't see that included in this survey Anna is awesome at helping you lift up your story whether that's with local policy makers your members of Congress your local nrcs office the Press if you have a short story you want to share around water connect with Anna and we can help you do that we're also going to have some more Fellowship cohorts coming up I mentioned we do water Fellowship programs to support farmer leadership so keep in touch we're going to have a new one we're planning to launch towards the end of this year and then uh last if you want to work with us especially on Farm Bill advocacy we have a place where you can sign up uh let us know and you'll be getting more information there and Anna's gonna throw that link in the chat um so that's the best way to stay in touch with what's happening at Young farmers and with our water campaign and just so you know who to talk to um we've got a small M ID team on our water team I'm our water director Anna is our water organizer and we also have a fellowship coordinator Megan Davey who I think I saw on this call Will through our contact information in the chat if you want to be in touch and I think that's all I have and I will pass it back to you to wrap us up thank you to all of our speakers they provided so much valuable information and also to everybody who joined from across the country it's so incredible to see people doing amazing work even from what I can tell in the chat and um yeah I wish to have more time with each of you especially if you're interested I hear a lot of feedback for nrcs and they need to hear it directly from you um we have organizers across the country in different states who are working to set up meetings uh there's folks like Hector a California organizer on the call um but I would suggest California folks reaching out to if you don't already know Hector those are our opportunities when we go and meet with nrcs staff just like our Congress people these are decision makers and folks who can communicate up the line to USDA staff What would we need to see both in the farm bill and in the offices across the country to make it more accessible for all of you to use and harness these programs and the funding that is out there and I hope that you all are able to I hope this was uh valuable information that you're able to walk away with um and if there's questions like I said this is not our last opportunity to connect um you have several times my contact information the other speakers as well um if you'd like to stay up to date we will have a newsletter that link is posted in the chat um as well I encourage you all to reach out to others at Young Farmers those you've met on the call um and continue doing the amazing work again thank you all for joining us and I hope to see you next week or you know to share like I said feel free to share any of the information and recordings from this workshop with others you think will benefit um good luck with all of your endeavors and I hope you all have a beautiful rest of your day thank you",
