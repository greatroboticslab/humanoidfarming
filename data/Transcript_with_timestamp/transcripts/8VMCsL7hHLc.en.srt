1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,480
good morning and also good afternoon for

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,640
those that are joining from europe

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,680
i'm very pleased to share this panel

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,240
today

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,400
at the online dcmi 2020 conference

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,719
dedicated to challenges finding

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,920
information in food and agriculture

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,000
on the web what can we do better

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,320
and this panel is going to focus on food

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,640
and agricultural sciences

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,960
and as you will learn over the next 90

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,519
minutes

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
agriculture and disciplines related have

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,480
special

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,160
characteristics that make data

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,360
interoperability particularly

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,160
challenging

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,079
and so the work of certain genes to

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,480
collect scientific data

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:48,000
from one side in this particular um

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,840
sciences gray literature is crucial

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,520
while journal articles are not

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,000
necessarily the only scholarly

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,079
communication channel that counts

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,360
and secondly and the most important and

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,920
that is going to be

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,359
very much highlighted today is that

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,920
while in other sciences

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,920
english is the pivotal language in the

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,720
case of the foot in agriculture and due

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,080
to the diversity of languages behind

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,479
used it's necessary to consider

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,880
multi-language multilingualism and

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,520
semantic strategies as a way to increase

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,240
accessibility to all the scientific

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,240
literature through the use

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,799
we hope that at the end of this session

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,200
panelists will share some thoughts about

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,479
possible ways to address some of the

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,520
identified challenges as well possible

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,479
common synergies

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,079
to build on how how to bring them

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,799
forward

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,600
today we have panelists from the footing

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,119

and the beijing academy of agriculture

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,799
and forestry sciences that unfortunately

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,479
is not going to be physically

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,719
in this panel session due to time

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,880
constraints the time zone constraints

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,759
but we have a recording to present the

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,520
use case

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,880
that they would like to share with you

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,399
about the work that they are doing in

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,879
this field

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,239
we encourage to all of you to submit

60
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,239
your questions

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,560
through the chat box anytime don't be

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,200
shy just share

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
if you have any specific request for one

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,680
panelist

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,599
please add her name at the beginning of

66
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,360
your comment this will make

67
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,800
easy to go through the questions and

68
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,120
answers part

69
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,040
and don't forget that we like to hear

70
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,000
from you as well this is an interactive

71
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,840
session

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,760
where we would like also to learn from

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,080
your thoughts and experiences if you

74
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,879
have

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,720
any in this field or in any other field

76
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,920
that you think that could be

77
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,160
also of interest for the audience

78
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,959
so this panel will start with a short

79
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,800
presentation

80
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,080
by each of the panelists and this is

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,680
going to bring us

82
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,440
uh to take more or less 60 minutes

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,760
and after that we will start with the

84
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,159
questions and answers

85
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,560
but uh before we continue with the

86
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,480
session let me introduce myself

87
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,920
because of course probably you don't

88
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,360
know me at all

89
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,640
so i'm in mr village i'm a senior

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,040
information management

91
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,440
um uh at fau and i'm the program manager

92
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,040
for agrees in anger work which will be

93
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,239
also presented today

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,519
during our discussion instead that you

95
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,280
have here in the zoom

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,480

97
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,480
um by the order that was

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,760
displayed in the announcement of this

99
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,239
session before

100
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,440
i would like to introduce our first

101
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,799

thank you excellent

112
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,160
excellent thank you i'm here today to

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,720
talk about the ag data commons usda's

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,280
general

115
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,519
ag data catalog and repository which is

116
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,960
designed to help usda researchers

117
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,040
publish and disseminate data products

118
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,000
the national agriculture library is one

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,560
of five national

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,320
libraries of the united states it houses

121
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
one of the world's largest collections

122
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,040
devoted to agriculture

123
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,120
and its related sciences

124
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,280
nal provides a variety of online

125
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,280
resources including journal articles

126
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,360
digital collections and other materials

127
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,960
relating to agriculture

128
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,960
i'm going to focus on the ag data

129
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,120
commons for today's presentation

130
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,919
the ag data commons is a catalog and

131
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,960
data repository for usda-funded research

132
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,360
data

133
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,840
it provides expert services for creating

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,120
curating and enabling access to complete

135
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,600
and machine readable

136
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,840
scientific metadata it creates

137
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,000
infrastructure for linking information

138
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,240
data data publications people and more

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and it helps the usda funded research

140
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,800
community meet public access

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,800
requirements

142
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,240
an ag data commons data set consists of

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,479
data files and associated metadata

144
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,320
we provide tools and services to make

145
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,120
each data set richer and more

146
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,120
discoverable

147
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,000
the ag data commons strives to deliver

148
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,560
fair metadata that are machine readable

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,160
and available via apis and other

150
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,880
automated means

151
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,400
as a generalist ag repository we focus

152
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,560
most heavily on the f

153
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,880
and the a of this matrix since

154
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,039
interoperability and reusability

155
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,120
generally require subject-specific

156
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,039
adherence to more regimented

157
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,039
data and metadata standards

158
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,560
to that end the ag data commons provides

159
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,600
discovery

160
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,880
and access as its core function search

161
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,479
and discovery tools

162
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,919
and linked information promote

163
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
findability

164
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,759
we enable access through the catalog and

165
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,720
public apis

166
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,759
use of open licenses and dois for

167
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,759
digital assets

168
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,280
the ag data commons synthesizes metadata

169
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,440
to achieve a variety of services

170
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,600
i like the analogy of lego blocks to

171
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,280
represent ag data commons metadata

172
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,919
because the pieces come in different

173
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,400
colors

174
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,720
shapes and sizes and can be assembled in

175
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
a variety of ways to perform a variety

176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,960
of functions

177
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,880
our metadata system is no different we

178
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,440
ask for essential information about the

179
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,360
data and rearrange that input to satisfy

180
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,520
the needs of each service that the ag

181
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,000
data commons offers

182
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,520
we often work with geospatial metadata

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,080
which must use the iso 19115 standard

184
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,160
and this standard underpins our internal

185
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,840
systems because it's robust enough to

186
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,840
handle the information from the other

187
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
standards

188
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,440
one use case that illustrates this

189
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,280
metadata synthesis

190
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,039
includes our work with the ag cross

191
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,759
repository

192
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,160
ag cross specializes in geospatial data

193
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,000
and uses an iso 19115

194
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,240
flavor of metadata in an esri platform

195
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,160
we ingest metadata and data by

196
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,319
harvesting from agros using

197
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,840
microservices architecture according to

198
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,000
best practices

199
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,039
and create the ag data commons record

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,599
and store the data files locally

201
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,240
we then reformat that metadata to the

202
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,960
data site format and reserve a doi

203
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,080
using an internal system which then gets

204
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,720
added back to the ag data commons record

205
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,800
finally the doi is pushed back to agros

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,879
for display with their record using a

207
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,800
restful api

208
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,240
records tagged with specific bureau

209
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,800
codes are also forwarded to data.gov

210
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,120
this way agros researchers can utilize

211
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,199
their subject specific platform

212
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,440
but also benefit from the discovery and

213
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,919
access services the ag data commons

214
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,919
offers

215
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,520
we offer a wide assortment of fields to

216
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,879
data submitters with a great deal of

217
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,120
linking potential

218
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,280
but we need to strike a balance between

219
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,280
information that makes data fair

220
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,800
and how much data submitters are willing

221
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,960
to fill out

222
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,680
when we present too many requirements

223
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,840
people simply won't fill out

224
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,000
they simply just won't submit their data

225
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,919
or they opt for repositories with a

226
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
lower bar of entry

227
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,680
when we allow submissions with too few

228
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,640
completed fields the data set

229
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,839
findability

230
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,760
and potential reusability suffers

231
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,320
after reviewing the requirements for the

232
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,480
services ag data commons facilitates

233
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,800
we arrived at this core set of essential

234
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,720
metadata for each record

235
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,839
this list doesn't account for some of

236
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,519
the subject subject-specific

237
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,120
requirements certain research

238
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,360
communities may need

239
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,600
but we cover our bases as a generalist

240
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,600
ag catalog with this set of metadata

241
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,080
during the curation process our staff

242
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,839
also adds nal thesaurus terms to ag data

243
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,240
commons records

244
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,399
the nal thesaurus is used to select

245
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,560
controlled vocabulary terms for

246
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,720
subject indexing in several of the

247
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,959
library's databases

248
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,120
the thesaurus is produced in part by the

249
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,560
national agricultural library

250
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,120
is updated annually and contains over

251
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,080
260 000

252
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:36,560
terms it's available as linked open data

253
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,320
for anyone to use

254
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,560
the ag data commons provides the

255
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,680
infrastructure for linking metadata and

256
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,760
objects to enable analytical tools

257
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,000
we provide specific fields for these

258
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,120
relationships to maximize the linking

259
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,640
and machine readability of the metadata

260
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,800
this includes different types of

261
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,160
relationships between data sets and

262
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,880
documentation

263
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,160
author identification links like orcid

264
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,160
and version guidance

265
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,399
we provide features to promote credit

266
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,000
for usda researchers as an incentive to

267
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,320
deposit data with us

268
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,480
and to provide more complete records

269
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,120
with linked information

270
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,399
u.s federal data should be openly and

271
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,480
freely available

272
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,760
but the ag data commons makes it easier

273
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,480
for researchers to give

274
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,640
and receive credit for their work

275
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,880
citations are automatically generated

276
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,720
for all records in the catalog and

277
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,760
researchers can link to their scholarly

278
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,880
publications

279
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,360
data papers and other related content

280
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,120
we also provide dois for locally held

281
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,040
data files which has been a big

282
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,000
incentive for researchers to share their

283
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,000
data publicly

284
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,399
now as much as we do well there are

285
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,839
still plenty of challenges we face in

286
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,880
making data findable

287
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,880
and accessible

288
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,760
our search features offer a particular

289
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,600
opportunity for improvement

290
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,680
we've been working with our stakeholders

291
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,079
to develop search requirements to use

292
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,360
while we evaluate database platforms for

293
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,839
our 2021

294
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,839
upgrade

295
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,800
our data content represents a diverse

296
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,760
set of research topics and metadata

297
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,000
needs

298
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,480
we can't be all things to all people and

299
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,640
instead focus on the services we offer

300
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,640
and the metadata required to accomplish

301
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,800
those tasks

302
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,680
an ale thesaurus application is not

303
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,079
currently automated and that's a problem

304
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,079
we plan to work more closely with nal's

305
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,399
indexing and informatics branch to

306
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,279
improve not term application and provide

307
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,480
better linkage

308
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,680
between various library systems and yet

309
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,680
another challenge

310
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,760
involves which controlled vocabularies

311
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,839
to implement and how to link them to

312
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,160
authoritative sources

313
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,600
we chose taxonomies related directly to

314
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,760
nal's services

315
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,760
but seek a better and more effective way

316
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,279
to integrate controlled vocabularies

317
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,120
used by the different

318
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,120
specific areas we support

319
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,320
our metadata enriches our data sets but

320
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,600
doesn't always make them more

321
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,680
discoverable outside of our own platform

322
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,519
some of this relates to infrastructure

323
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,600
and some to culture

324
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,079
for instance orcid accounts can

325
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
automatically link data sets with dois

326
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,600
we issue

327
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,560
from their author profile pages but many

328
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,440
account holders

329
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,040
don't turn on that feature we can

330
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,880
capture rich information

331
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,639
but strive to increase the linked

332
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,040
information we provide

333
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,200
to that end we work to convey the value

334
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,880
of linked information to the researchers

335
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,600
submitting the data

336
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,200
more fields often represents more burden

337
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,639
for data submitters

338
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,480
so we look for ways to make the

339
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,240
submission process easier and to

340
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,240
communicate the added value

341
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
as information professionals we

342
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,079
understand how complete and linked

343
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,959
information enhances data

344
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,440
sets however to get the absolute most

345
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,160
utility out of data sets we must educate

346
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,000
submitters

347
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,839
and communicate the value of linked

348
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,079
information while lessening the

349
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,440
submission burden so data becomes more

350
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,760
easily findable and accessible

351
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,920
thank you that's my presentation here

352
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,079
are a few of the links that i

353
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,440
showed throughout my presentation and i

354
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,440
will hand it back to emma

fabrizio celli um fabrizio

361
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,040
is part of um the team that is managing

362
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,720
aggregates the international system for

363
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,120
agricultural science and technology

364
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,199
actually he is the technical leader

365
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,800
and he is working for the food and

366
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,000
agriculture organization of united

367
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,560
nations welcome

368
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
to the panel fabrizio and over to you

369
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,000
thank you very much emma

370
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,440
okay in this session

371
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,320
we will be looking at how aggress is

372
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,040
addressing challenges in finding and

373
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,839
integrating research in food and

374
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,839
agriculture

375
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,480
i want to give you some background about

376
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,000
phao

377
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,920
and aggressive fallow is the food and

378
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,040
agriculture organization of the united

379
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,040
nations

380
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,760
and it's the organization that is

381
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,199
maintaining aggressor

382
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,279
faust's goal is to lead the

383
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,800
international efforts to defeat hunger

384
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,160
and to improve nutrition and food

385
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,360
security

386
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,760
he was founded in 1945 and

387
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,959
the headquarter is in rome even if our

388
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,880
operates in over 130 countries

389
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:50,160
in 1974 uh foul set up an initiative

390
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,199
together with the member countries

391
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,399
uh to uh make information on agriculture

392
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,399
globally available

393
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,519
the outcome of this initiative was

394
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,360
aggressive

395
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,760
agaris is a database of almost

396
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,680
12 million of multilingual bibliographic

397
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,920
metadata agriculture research

398
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:13,360
but it is also a big network of

399
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,800
as you can see 434 data providers

400
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,760
from 150 countries uh

401
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,639
the uh importance of aggress is also

402
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,360
given by the fact that it's highly used

403
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,440
so according to google analytics aggress

404
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,240
receives around 8 million of visits per

405
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,639
month

406
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,240
and is accessed from all over the world

407
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,880
200 countries and

408
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
territories

409
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,639
before talking about the new challenges

410
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,160
that

411
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,480
agrius has to address uh i want to

412
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,199
show i want to describe a little bit how

413
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,959
uh

414
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,040
the data providers so the aggregate

415
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:53,360
provider has changed over the time

416
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,839
so at the beginning uh in 1974

417
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,839
government

418
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,279
centers whose role was to collect all

419
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,880
the scientific production

420
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,040
in their country and to send the data to

421
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,240
aggress then

422
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,680
from 2005 aggressors started to accept

423
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,759
also data from institutional

424
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,519
repositories from publishers

425
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,959
and from aggregators usually in this

426
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,759
case agrees doesn't go

427
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,480
to an institution and ask for data but

428
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,480
thanks to

429
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,480
the visibility that tagri says

430
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,120
institutions come to aggress

431
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,800
asking if they can publish data and we

432
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,079
can face here problems

433
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,720
of integration of the data on the other

434
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,519
end

435
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,560
with the evolution of the technology and

436
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,440
also of the

437
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,320
open access institutional repositories

438
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,360
agrees uh

439
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,680
uh as to cope also with problems related

440
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,160
to

441
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,279
automatic discovery automatic harvesting

442
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,199
and processing

443
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,959
of data and metadata available on the

444
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,320
web

445
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:58,720
so just to summarize uh there are two

446
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,800
big areas in terms of challenges

447
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,120
on one side we have the problem of the

448
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,319
integration of new data so when there is

449
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,520
a new data provider

450
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,000
there are several problems to be solved

451
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,760
in order to guarantee that the metadata

452
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,880
can be correctly published in aggression

453
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,360
that can benefit

454
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,199
of all the features that give a lot of

455
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,640
visibility to aggress data

456
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,720
so for example uh considering uh the

457
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,400
variety of the data providers and the

458
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,760
fact that they come from all over the

459
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,160
world

460
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,559
they always use different metadata

461
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,960
formats and different standards

462
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,120
and most important uh there are very

463
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,000
different levels of metadata quality

464
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,799
so while there are data providers who

465
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,200
has made a

466
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,480
very rich metadata records on the other

467
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,480
end we can find

468
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,480
some data providers with very poor

469
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,440
records and these of course create a

470
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,160
problem of

471
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,320
balance inside the aggress database

472
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,520
other issues are for example related to

473
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,520
the full text links

474
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,440
and also the stability of the links

475
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,280
agrees uh uh

476
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,880
always suggests to add the link to the

477
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,000
full text

478
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,880
but uh considering that agrees uh

479
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,440
the agree started in 1974 most of the

480
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,679
links

481
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,679
are corrupted so aggress needs to

482
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,240
periodically review all the links to

483
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,000
guarantee that they are still working

484
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,240
then the other important problem is

485
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,400
about multilingualism

486
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,280
in fact uh considering the tag is just

487
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,000
metadata in

488
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,679
up to 90 languages the pro some problems

489
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,840
can

490
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,039
can exist when aggress receives regulars

491
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,919
especially with text encoding

492
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,720
everybody should use unicode utf-8 in

493
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,400
order to guarantee

494
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,840
interoperability of the metadata in all

495
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,840
the languages

496
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,400
the second area is about the automatic

497
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,960
discovery and the ingestion of data

498
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,600
directly from web apis for example using

499
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,880
the iph protocol or using like restful

500
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,520
apis

501
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,559
uh two big problems here are the

502
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,600
relevance

503
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:00,160
of high volume data in fact when you

504
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,520
uh search for data on the web and you

505
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,919
want to automatically

506
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,960
uh harvest and ingest data into the

507
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,200
database

508
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,240
it is difficult to be sure about the

509
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,360
relevance so

510
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,280
the fact that the data is relevant to

511
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,520
the topics available in the address

512
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,039
database

513
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,960
the second issue is really the two

514
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,919
content classification and to the

515
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,320
integration

516
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,160
of uh this data automatically are vested

517
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,880
from the web

518
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,240
now about the integration agrees uh set

519
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,280
up an orchestration

520
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,360
of uh software components

521
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,039
even if at the beginning we have a

522
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,840
manual validation

523
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,799
of the metadata so there is a physical

524
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,799
person who

525
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,840
receives the metadata and checks the

526
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,640
metadata

527
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,000
uh for uh in order to understand this

528
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,960
first of all it is relevant to the

529
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,280
aggress domain

530
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,520
and second if there are semantics error

531
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,600
for example or problems with encoding

532
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,039
this is something that is possible for

533
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,000
regular data providers but

534
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,600
not when metadata are automatically

535
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,039
harvested from the web because they're

536
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,080
the volume of the data it's very high

537
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,559
and it's impossible to do this manually

538
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,919
after this is done uh aggress has a lot

539
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,320
of processes to

540
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,320
convert and harmonize all the metadata

541
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,720
from a lot of formats to an aggress

542
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,720
internal format which is aggressive

543
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,960
and then to perform some operations like

544
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,679
data cleaning metadata enrichment

545
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,320
in order to reach the final version of

546
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,919
uh

547
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:31,200
the the record which is the aggressor df

548
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,840
so these allows aggress to enable

549
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,360
the usage of linked open data

550
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,200
technologies

551
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,039
so aggressor is not giving any

552
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,280
suggestions in terms of

553
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,880
input metadata format

554
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,200
[Music]

555
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,000
agrees tries to accept everything even

556
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,559
if there are

557
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,880
several challenges here poor metadata so

558
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,559
like missing metadata fields

559
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,880
uh lack for example of controlled

560
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,880
vocabularism

561
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,720
wrong usage of metadata properties and

562
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,799
as i told you in case of multilingual

563
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,440
regulars also problems with encodings

564
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,080
this is why aggress recommends to

565
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,720
consider the load of bd recommendations

566
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,559
which are recommendations in terms of

567
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,400
metadata properties to use

568
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,640
and also in terms of vocabularies to use

569
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,679
and they can help to standardize a

570
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,120
little bit uh

571
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,760
the situation and to help the

572
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,520
integration of the metadata coming from

573
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:28,880
uh such a variety of data providers

574
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,080
uh of course it's important to build

575
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,200
also some capacity

576
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,000
development development this is uh

577
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,799
because agaris has learned a lot over

578
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,400
the time

579
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:43,440
and the only way to help data providers

580
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,080
to produce better metadata is to

581
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,080
uh train also data providers so the

582
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,760
first step is email exchange so when

583
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,000
there are new data providers

584
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,039
and aggress understands that there are

585
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
errors

586
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,640
uh or semantic errors or other kind of

587
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,159
problems

588
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,200
there is a chain of email exchange with

589
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,120
the data provider

590
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,480
to guide the data provider to produce

591
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,039
better

592
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,039
richer and meaningful metadata then

593
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,000
there are also webinars guides on the

594
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,159
websites and

595
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,600
recommendations as i told you before

596
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,520
with the lord apd recommendations

597
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,280
now an important piece of the

598
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,360
aggregate's infrastructure is agrovoc

599
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,360
this is a controlled vocabulary covering

600
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,480
all the areas of interest of file it's

601
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,120
translated into 39 languages and

602
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,120
it's the backbone of aggress so this is

603
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,799
used for example 12 pages

604
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,240
with automatic data discovery and

605
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,120
classification aggro

606
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,440
can factories use them within some

607
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,280
machine learning algorithms

608
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,440
that allows agris to understand the

609
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,919
relevance of the metadata which are

610
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,200
automatically harvested and downloaded

611
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,960
from the web plus aggro voca is also

612
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,720
very important to enables a lot of

613
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,120
additional features on the website

614
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,640
like the multilingual search like the

615
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,520
improvement of the precision and the

616
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,360
recall

617
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,720
like the possibility to connect

618
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,960
different resources

619
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,640
so using linked open data technologies

620
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,880
and as i told you also

621
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,240
in several machine learning algorithms

622
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,360
both to determine

623
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,640
the relevance of harvested resources but

624
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,880
also to classify

625
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,600
resources according using these

626
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,559
multilingual tests

627
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,520
and that's it from my side thank you

628
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:27,760
very much

629
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:30,799
thank you very much fabrizio so we move

630
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:34,240
now to our third

data sharing

638
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,240
information analysis and semantic

639
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,760
technology technology research

640
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:57,279
as i mentioned before unfortunately

for construction and sharing of

657
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,400
agricultural information resources

658
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,600
challenges and how to deal with these

659
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,880
changes in the future

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,200
agricultural economic management et

680
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,520
cetera

681
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,600
our team has been engaged in the

682
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,720
construction of agriculture information

683
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,120
resources

684
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,120
data sharing and economic analysis for

685
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,760
nearly two decades

686
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,480
we set up the basic agriculture think

687
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,760
tank plate

688
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,200
form in 2017. the goal of this

689
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,600
platform is to build our resources with

690
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,480
well organized and functional of

691
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,600
agricultural science and technology

692
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,200
so service and platform to provide the

693
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,400
data sharing service

694
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,279
and the in-depth uh information analysis

695
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,679
service

696
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,880
for decision makers managers and

697
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,960
research

698
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,880
researchers we have been working towards

699
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,760
this goal

700
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,440
at present the platform has gathered

701
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,919
more than one million pieces of

702
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,080
agricultural information resources from

703
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,159
china other countries and a few

704
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,279
international organizations

705
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,880
according to the resource tabs the

706
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,760
platform brings together

707
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:36,840
12 categories of information resources

708
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,480
including patents news

709
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,559
policies etc according to the

710
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,240
agricultural theme the data is

711
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:49,360
divided into cedar industrial planting

712
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,559
industry animal husbandry

713
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,840
fisheries etc at

714
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:59,840
present resources is mainly in chinese

715
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:03,840
and english resources for mice include

716
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,840
text pdf or

717
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,880
new numerical values and so on

718
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:16,400
there are four unknown tenures for data

719
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,159
acquisition one is the internal

720
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,279
data of dafs as baafi's owns

721
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:26,320
a lot of primary data resources

722
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,159
such as the expert information

723
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,679
technology achievement

724
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:34,640
research report another one is the data

725
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,840
from the government and academic

726
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,960
association

727
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,159
they get it through comprehend

728
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,799
concrete and creative construction

729
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,360
data exchange and so on suddenly the

730
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:51,919
open data from the internet

731
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,919
the last one is the commercial databases

732
00:27:52,320 --> 00:28:01,039
i think a good resource sharing platform

733
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,039
should have several heretics

734
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:08,640
abundance in resources uh

735
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:11,520
a story authority authoritative

736
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,039
and reliable family in update

737
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,880
standardized

738
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:20,159
food in um

739
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,799
for data specialists

740
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,399
spec picture and the data organization

741
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:29,120
with the data and the semantics

742
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:31,840
okay it really can change the

743
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,039
and how theoretical data into

744
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,200
standardized

745
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,279
and available data facilitator

746
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,399
data management and the data quality

747
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:44,399
assessment

748
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:48,080
submitted the data into grid and sharing

749
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:51,600
semantic technology can deplete

750
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,640
diseased and nearly potential

751
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,520
or releasing zipper amount data

752
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,720
and that can be applied can be applied

753
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,760
to resource

754
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,640
retrieval resource recommendation data

755
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,279
association

756
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:10,720
data discovery etc we have also held

757
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:14,720
down some preliminary work

758
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,840
in the regard metadata standards has

759
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,480
been established

760
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,520
to standardize the data processing and

761
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,080
management

762
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,320
a communicative model of agriculture

763
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,559
information resource database

764
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,840
dataset is established by fully

765
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,559
considering

766
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,520
the metadata content necessary for data

767
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,120
content

768
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:38,240
data display data development etc

769
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:41,919
including include the title subject

770
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:45,039
object keyword type for provider

771
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,159
etc on the basis of

772
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,640
common metadata different data is

773
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,440

challenges agricultural information

802
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,799
resources are limited

805
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:21,200
are many resources data formats

806
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,320
are varied and the most are not just

807
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,960

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,240
often missing with data attributes arrow

extraction extension and other aspects

817
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:54,000
still need plenty of manual

818
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
participation

819
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,480

820
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,360
includes

821
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,720
chinese english and other languages so

822
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,600
it is difficult

823
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,720
to achieve the unified resource

824
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:14,399
retrieval and the data association of

825
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:18,320
multiple languages

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:24,320
future plan carry out extensive

827
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:26,880
cooperation with more organization of

828
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,000
agricultural information resources

829
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,039
stronger the research and application

830
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,080
of ai technology in abstract

831
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:40,159
extensive extraction

832
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:43,360
automatic tagging of a keyword subject

833
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:47,120
class fixture and so on try to achieve

834
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,559
almighty language unified retrieval and

835
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,080

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:59,760
medal led's one of the three models of

866
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,200
the cgir platform for big data and

867
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,440
agriculture

868
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,960
spur heading efforts to operationalize

869
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,360
the fair principles towards

870
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,480
fundable accessible interoperable and

871
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,800
reusable

872
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,800
data across the cgir's 13 centers

873
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,480
thank you for being here medline over to

874
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,359
you

875
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,480
thanks emma and thanks to the organizers

876
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,399
for having me

877
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,679
let me know if you can't hear me clearly

878
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,520
or if you're

879
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,200
something goes awry with the screen

880
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,639
sharing but you should be able to see my

881
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,639
screen now hopefully correct

882
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,119
yes okay good good um

883
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,240
so i'm going to launch right in uh first

884
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,399
of all i'm going to acknowledge my

885
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,079
co-authors who could not be here uh so

886
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,119
thieris and pythagoras

887
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,800
from scio and they have helped us

888
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,159
uh greatly with this and a lot of what

889
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,200
i'm going to be talking about

890
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,560
is in fact thanks to them uh let me

891
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,480
start in with an introduction like the

892
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,240
others have given about cgir because i'm

893
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,359
not sure how many people know

894
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,800
uh that cgir is

895
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,400
a network of 15 research for development

896
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,040
centers focused mostly

897
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,599
in the global south it is the largest

898
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,960
global

899
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:14,480
agricultural innovation network and um

900
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,400
we so i mentioned the 15 centers we we

901
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,880
have a local presence in over 100

902
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,000
countries most of those countries

903
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,960
with gdps of less than a dollar a day

904
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,400
we've been around for most of most of

905
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,760
the centers have been around for about

906
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,599
50 years

907
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,520
and we have large networks of

908
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,800
partnerships um

909
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,119
we also have uh uh some of the

910
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,079
the work that we do is across uh our

911
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,960
gene banks which hold or are stewards of

912
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,079
um

913
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,320
a very large number of crop seed

914
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,280
essentially accessions is germ plasma

915
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,599
accessions

916
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,640
um so in a nutshell uh that's that's

917
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,359
really cgir

918
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,200
what what we focus on really is uh

919
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,000
poverty reduction particularly in rural

920
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,280
areas

921
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,839
um uh we work on on issues related to

922
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,160
food

923
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,119
food um security and and nutritional

924
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,000
security

925
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,240
and we try to do that in in a sort of a

926
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,960
an

927
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,000
environmentally sustainable way with

928
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,160
regard for

929
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,680
natural resource management um and

930
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,920
ecosystem services

931
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,760
um so so that's just to sort of set the

932
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,880
stage a little bit on what cgir

933
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,079
is uh as we work um

934
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,800
in our centers what we find is as

935
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,280
as everybody here has i think alluded to

936
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,640
is a

937
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,160
is an increasingly digitized and digital

938
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,640
agriculture so this is sort of a

939
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,440
conceptual model of a future farm

940
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,280
uh not not in the us or in europe but

941
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,240
actually in

942
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,520
africa somewhere or could be south asia

943
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,640
this is really where

944
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,160
um things are going very digital as many

945
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,480
of the speakers have mentioned

946
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,200
ai artificial intelligence and machine

947
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,480
learning

948
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,440
uh i come from the big data platform

949
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,400
where we have the technologies to be

950
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,960
deriving

951
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,040
um insights and solutions from data

952
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,720
large pools of data in fact

953
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,160
but to do that we need to be able to

954
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,680
find and access the data something

955
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,000
you've heard about in earlier

956
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,599
presentations as well we need to be able

957
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,760
to interpret that data not just as

958
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,599
humans but as machines as well

959
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,520
we increasingly need to be able to

960
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,800
aggregate large amounts of

961
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,079
related data sets and we we generally

962
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,560
need to be able to visualize

963
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,000
map and of course analyze that data to

964
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,160
derive insights from it

965
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,119
so that's kind of the the scenario that

966
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,040
we work in

967
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,400
and for the big data platform one of the

968
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,520
things that we're trying to do

969
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,520
is assume open uh open access to our

970
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,119
data our research data by default but

971
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,280
focus on fair data and i don't think i

972
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,000
need to go much more into what there is

973
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,320
um other people have mentioned this what

974
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,560
i'm

975
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,040
showing you here is sort of our kind of

976
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,359
overall approach to doing this

977
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,200
this is a schematic that shows uh the

978
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,240
the organized modules

979
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,880
uh uh efforts to make data open

980
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,599
and fair and and and so the heart of

981
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,920
this

982
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,880
is the guardian data discovery portal

983
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,680
which enables

984
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,359
um sort of wider discovery and use by

985
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,680
google data sets for instance

986
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,040
uh and other search engines uh by

987
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,320
external apps for

988
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,560
farmers and policy makers uh and and it

989
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,119
does that by harvesting metadata from a

990
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,160
number of different uh

991
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,000
repositories or data platforms and by

992
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,720
data here i mean both publications and

993
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,520
data

994
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,880
platforms so for cgir centers we have 15

995
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,960
centers as i said

996
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,240
uh that amounts to 30 odd repositories

997
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,280
because each center typically

998
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,800
tends to have unfortunately a one data

999
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,839
repository and one publications

1000
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,079
repository

1001
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,280
typically unlinked so you don't know

1002
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,760
what

1003
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,440
publication was built using what data

1004
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,000
very often

1005
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,480
so that's 30 repositories we're also

1006
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,800
making data discoverable from usaid's

1007
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,599
digital data library from what used to

1008
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,000
be diffid

1009
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,720
um and i can never remember what that

1010
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,040
fcdo

1011
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,079
stands for but it used to be diffid uh

1012
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,720
the the the

1013
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,440
british equivalent of usa roughly

1014
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,599
speaking

1015
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,280
we have some data and an increasing

1016
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,240
amount of data and publications from the

1017
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,280
world bank

1018
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,680
uh we also make discoverable uh what

1019
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,040
aaron talked about earlier usda usda's

1020
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,160
ag data commons

1021
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,480
and we have the genesis platform from

1022
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,359
our uh gene banks which i've already

1023
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,240
mentioned

1024
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,119
um earlier we also have data and

1025
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,200
publications

1026
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,320
visible from the government of india's

1027
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,320
open data portal

1028
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,320
focusing primarily on the ag part of

1029
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,079
that because there's much more there

1030
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,320
um and there's a dataverse sitting

1031
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,000
behind this uh for those who want to

1032
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,560
upload their data

1033
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,480
and for that we have built workflows to

1034
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,839
comply with um

1035
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,839
based on ontologies and control

1036
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,280
vocabularies that that form the

1037
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,240
standards so these workflows

1038
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,320
we the fair workflows are intended to

1039
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,880
generate data that's that's um

1040
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,160
consistently described uh in terms of

1041
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,640
the the semantics

1042
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,640
of the data and then uh we're also

1043
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,480
developing digital tools to collect data

1044
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,880
that's already standards compliance

1045
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,520
already built on ontologies and and and

1046
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,400
such

1047
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,079
um and of course the the the primary

1048
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,079
piece of all of this is the so what you

1049
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,079
can find data as a big deal

1050
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,680
and here what i'm showing you is the the

1051
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,240
sort of pipelines that we're building

1052
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,800
out

1053
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,480
uh to be able to analyze the data to

1054
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,240
visualize it and explore it

1055
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,000
both semantically as well as visually in

1056
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,079
in maps and being able to query it that

1057
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,079
way as well so

1058
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,160
um just a quick view of what this looks

1059
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,200
like uh this is a search done in

1060
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,680
guardian on

1061
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,200
on the terms here on nutrition women uh

1062
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,520
the idea is i want to find

1063
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,119
data on nutrition as it affects women so

1064
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,880
i go to guardian i type in those

1065
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:47,760
keywords and here you see a quick grab

1066
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,400
which you see data coming from three of

1067
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,040
our cgir centers if brielle re and sip

1068
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,440
as well as fcdo which used to be diffid

1069
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,200
uh

1070
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,640
usaid's ddl data.gov and you may not be

1071
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,599
able to see the bottom one which is the

1072
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,680
world bank

1073
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,280
um there are a number of publications

1074
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,160
and data sets that are being discovered

1075
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,800
here there's

1076
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,359
different ways to filter uh across the

1077
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,359
top

1078
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,839
and and to to and to look at that data

1079
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,760
here and of course i did i did mention

1080
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,200
usda act data commons gene max

1081
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,880
if you go further down this you're

1082
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,040
likely to find data sets from

1083
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,640
particularly from ag data commons not so

1084
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,359
much from gene banks here

1085
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,720
um so to do this to to be able to enable

1086
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,359
this sort of view

1087
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,359
um you you need somehow to harmonize a

1088
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,400
number of different metadata schemas and

1089
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,760
this is where

1090
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,119
uh that a lot of the work uh that

1091
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,079
pythagoras sensor theories do

1092
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,240
particularly

1093
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,440
for guardian uh comes into play so

1094
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,160
guardian enriches

1095
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,640
the native metadata that comes in from

1096
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,960
uh

1097
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,800
the repositories where the data sits uh

1098
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,240
to enhance their fairness particularly

1099
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,839
focusing on the findability and

1100
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,599
accessibility um

1101
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,040
so here's an example this is this is

1102
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,680
from one of our centers

1103
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,119
um uh uh this is a publication from one

1104
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,400
of our centers simet

1105
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,319
um and and here what what uh

1106
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,119
what what was done when you look at this

1107
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,920
particular uh the same publication

1108
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,640
as it's viewed in guardian what what's

1109
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,960
been done

1110
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,839
is a sort of a standardization of the of

1111
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,599
the

1112
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,680
first name last name format of the

1113
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,720
authors from what you see

1114
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,040
here which is kind of you know mixed

1115
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,280
it's

1116
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,880
it's not a consistent format to a much

1117
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,400
more consistent format

1118
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,119
um and then also a deduping so so this

1119
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,240
this same date this same publication is

1120
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,880
available both from the

1121
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,880
from the diffid um repository as well as

1122
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,599
simmets repository we've deduped it and

1123
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,920
made it

1124
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,119
uh you know consistently available just

1125
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,880
from this one place

1126
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,359
if you go further down in that same

1127
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,640
publication you see a set of keywords

1128
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,800
and these keywords

1129
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,800
um are both keywords that have been

1130
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,040
input typically by

1131
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,280
the the information and data managers uh

1132
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,839
but as it's been enriched as well

1133
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,880
uh by pulling from aggrovac as well as

1134
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,960
ontologies

1135
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,119
and so that's that's something that's uh

1136
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,359
very powerful and enhances the

1137
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,440
definability and accessibility of data

1138
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:10,240
this is another example

1139
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,760
uh which we showed you here uh a data

1140
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,880
set from um

1141
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,720
actually not a data set it's a

1142
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,680
publication from acresat one of our

1143
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,520
other centers

1144
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:23,040
in india um and here you see um

1145
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,319
an enhancement of of the resource

1146
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,920
um using geonames so it's it's this was

1147
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,640
something that was absent in the

1148
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,680
original

1149
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,720
uh publication sitting in the repository

1150
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,640
uh the metadata enrichment uh algorithms

1151
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,560
that are used by guardian allowed this

1152
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,560
to to happen using calling on geonames

1153
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,760
and the last example i want to uh give

1154
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,079
you is is sort of

1155
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,040
uh again the keywords that are enriched

1156
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,880
here um

1157
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,079
this is a data set now that's that's an

1158
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,800
ikrisab dataset

1159
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,359
uh again the center that's based in

1160
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
india

1161
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,440
and at the bottom of this you see a

1162
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,560
keyword cloud um as you did before

1163
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,000
in this case the the the words here

1164
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,680
are drawn from both aggravated

1165
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,880
ontologies the earlier example i showed

1166
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,800
you was agrabox

1167
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,240
um and and where the ontologies

1168
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,079
particularly common to play

1169
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,599
even sometimes they're behind the scenes

1170
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,079
they're not necessarily

1171
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,119
part of this cloud but but they very

1172
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,079
much play a role

1173
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,920
in making data further discoverable say

1174
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,880
to google data

1175
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,520
so it's quite important in in in making

1176
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,920
the data

1177
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,920
fair not only within guardian but much

1178
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,040
beyond that increasing the

1179
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,760
the the discoverability of uh data more

1180
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,000
widely data assets more widely

1181
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,119
so this is my last slide i just want to

1182
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,920
talk quickly about some of the

1183
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,160
challenges

1184
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,839
that the team has faced um the scio team

1185
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,359
and in enriching in in

1186
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,800
in using these kinds of approaches and

1187
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,480
of course one of them is is

1188
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,040
harmonization in the in in the

1189
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,920
harvesting and harmonization step so

1190
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,680
here for cgir particular particularly we

1191
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,720
we do use a consistent metadata data

1192
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,440
schema that's

1193
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,160
um a sort of a an extension of dublin

1194
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,680
core

1195
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,520
um but there are differences in

1196
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,440
interpretation of labels and even if the

1197
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,839
metadata schema used by

1198
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,200
our our uh partners who we who we

1199
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,880
harvest from

1200
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,319
maps to to to dublin core um it it is a

1201
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,560
difficult proposition as has been

1202
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,160
referred to in earlier presentations

1203
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,560
i talked a little bit about deduping

1204
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,560
records um so that can be sort of a

1205
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,240
uh you know we have to be careful about

1206
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,920
doing that as well

1207
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,440
uh the quality and the richness of

1208
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,520
metadata uh

1209
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,480
uh is both of them are quite highly

1210
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,680
variable so

1211
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,560
so that you know for instance um for

1212
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,280
for uh in some instances you might see

1213
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,040
words

1214
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,400
in some in other instances you see

1215
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,119
something close to sentences or

1216
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,040
paragraphs

1217
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,480
in the keywords field which makes it a

1218
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,280
difficult proposition to know how to

1219
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,920
deal with

1220
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,599
um and then of course there's uh in in

1221
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,960
in some for some records

1222
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:53,280
um the the metadata uh

1223
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,160
is quite rich and in others it's it's

1224
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,319
very poor there

1225
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,839
there are you know just the most basic

1226
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,079
metadata available so

1227
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,920
there the text mining approaches that

1228
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,560
are used by our algorithms

1229
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,400
are become even more important with

1230
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,000
automated enrichment comes as sort of a

1231
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,319
pitfall as well so there's

1232
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,040
the potential for misinterpretation uh

1233
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,560
for instance

1234
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:17,280
i i came across a a data set a spatial

1235
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,160
a data set about spatial data and they

1236
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,160
talked in the

1237
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,000
abstract about grid cells but that was

1238
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,640
being interpreted by our algorithms as

1239
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,319
cells

1240
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,680
and so when you clicked on the on the

1241
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,079
cells in the in that

1242
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,720
cloud in the of the keywords what you

1243
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,880
got what you saw was a bunch of stuff on

1244
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,400
organismal you know the biological

1245
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,680
equivalent of cells which is not what

1246
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,440
this was about at all

1247
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,119
so so there's a danger there as well and

1248
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,040
then the the the one

1249
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,040
you know does one size fit fit all and

1250
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,599
it doesn't typically because here we're

1251
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,599
talking largely about um

1252
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,200
a variety of scales all the way from the

1253
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,880
genetic to the landscape

1254
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,720
um and in terms of disciplines all the

1255
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,359
way from the genomics

1256
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,960
to or the omics types of disciplines uh

1257
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,280
to socioeconomics

1258
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,359
to spatial data and there uh you know

1259
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,480
it's it's always a sort of a tussle

1260
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:06,640
um and and compromises are involved

1261
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,319
in terms of the the metadata and

1262
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,599
enriching that of course has its own

1263
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,040
special

1264
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,040
challenges and pitfalls as you can

1265
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,720
imagine so that's

1266
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,400
um pretty much all i wanted to say i

1267
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,520
wanted to give you a flavor of how we

1268
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,400
approach this

1269
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,040
at cgir and i'm happy to take questions

1270
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,079
later on

1271
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:27,680
thank you thank you mida

1272
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:31,100
um excellent so we move to our last

1273
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,640
um presentation um

1274
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,640
[Music]

1275
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,079
and this is uh it's going to be

1276
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,480
delivered by laura

1277
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,839
medjularo is the team leader of the land

1278
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,079
portal foundation

1279
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:44,480
and she's responsible for the overall

1280
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,240
management implementation and expansion

1281
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:50,319
of the land portal

1282
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:53,440
i will be passing the slides on behalf

1283
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:56,559
laura just let me know laura when uh

1284
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:59,920
you want me to move thank you emma

1285
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:02,160
can you hear me yes thank you so much

1286
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,040
um thank you for this opportunity first

1287
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,200
of all i just wanted to say that

1288
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,200
introduce also my colleague carlo tejo

1289
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,079
who created these slides with me and we

1290
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,119
will be

1291
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,599
presenting uh together uh

1292
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,720
thank you so much so next slide please

1293
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,119
let me introduce

1294
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,319
uh quickly who we are the lamport

1295
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,680
foundation is a small

1296
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:26,559
dutch non-profit organization

1297
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,319
we've been working over the last 10

1298
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,440
years to address

1299
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:34,960
the extreme fragmentation of land data

1300
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:38,079
providing a free and open information

1301
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,520
uh for for a rather small community so

1302
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,640
the land sector

1303
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,920
uh the land governance sector is a very

1304
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,440
specialized

1305
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:50,480
sector within the agricultural domain um

1306
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,280
and according to it so they have very

1307
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,200
special needs so according to land

1308
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,680
researchers and practitioners

1309
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,119
so access to land is key for nutrition

1310
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,200
and food security and increases

1311
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,920
investment agricultural productivity

1312
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,280
improves people live food so so access

1313
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,559
to land is at the heart

1314
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,960
of this small specialized community i'm

1315
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,079
not

1316
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:15,599
um i mean our

1317
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,599
numbers are much smaller than those of

1318
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,559
my previous colleagues but i

1319
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:22,720
just wanted to uh let you understand

1320
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:26,480
what what

1321
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:29,280
what audience and what community we are

1322
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,440
serving so when it comes to access to

1323
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,680
data and information

1324
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,359
it's proved to be very close close

1325
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,720
sector the vast majority of

1326
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:41,839
land governance data remains closed

1327
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,200
fragmented poorly organized with poor

1328
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:45,359
metadata and

1329
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,240
many times with no metadata at all so

1330
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,240
they're representing

1331
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,440
if you search for land information on

1332
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:56,559
the web you you can find

1333
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,000
only few information providers so this

1334
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,119
means a very narrow range of

1335
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,079
perspectives

1336
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,040
and content to keep to be published in a

1337
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,160
way that is not

1338
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,599
doesn't facilitate discovery discovery

1339
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,960
engagement and reuse

1340
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:14,480
so because land is a cross-cutting

1341
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,720
issue and very um politicized

1342
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,200
so analyzing land governance often means

1343
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:22,000
looking at not only different data types

1344
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,480
but also diff across different domains

1345
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,599
so

1346
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,880
it also involves

1347
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,720
looking at different data stakeholders

1348
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,079
so not only academia

1349
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:36,960
so research data but also the data

1350
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,839
provided by governments um civil society

1351
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,160
or private sector

1352
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:44,240
um data providers so different

1353
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,440
with different degrees of data

1354
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,440
capabilities

1355
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:53,680
so our response to this extreme

1356
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,880
extreme fragmentation and accessibility

1357
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,079
of information

1358
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,280
is twofold so on one hand we develop

1359
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,680
an archer a multilingual platform

1360
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,200
lanportal.org

1361
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:08,240
that hosts a wide range of

1362
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,480
um organized country issuing data set

1363
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:14,559
pages where we aggregate and pull

1364
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,839
content data of different types such as

1365
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,839
bibliographic

1366
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:24,480
data statistical indicators

1367
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:27,440
spatial layers we create a repository of

1368
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,640
experts and sector organizations media

1369
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,599
content

1370
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,440
especially from southern countries and

1371
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,880
on the other hand

1372
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,920
we try to build capacity data capacity

1373
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,640
in the sector and also um

1374
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,119
a data infrastructure so in a few years

1375
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:48,000
the lan port has become a leading online

1376
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,800
destination for data and information in

1377
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,040
the sector

1378
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:55,280
so we have three main systems

1379
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,559
we have a geoportal that aggregates

1380
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,359
spatial layers

1381
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:01,680
a drupal website that aggregates

1382
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,920
bibliographic data a media content

1383
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,160
and a triple store for statistical data

1384
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,800
for the purpose of this presentation

1385
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,319
we will mainly focus on the land library

1386
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,280
that is a drupal

1387
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:15,200
instance where we maintain and create a

1388
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,359
repository

1389
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,960
of land governance related resources

1390
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:21,040
pulled from multiple sources

1391
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,160
in which the metadata mapped to semantic

1392
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,079
standards

1393
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:30,240
so next slide please this is our

1394
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:33,599
lan library so it includes again

1395
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:36,640
for us this is a big number and 61

1396
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:39,760
500 selected resources but i recognize

1397
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:43,359
that is a very small number compared to

1398
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:46,319
previous repositories but is

1399
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:48,480
this content is either published

1400
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:51,440
directly by our community of users or

1401
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:55,440
ingested through automatic

1402
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:59,599
importers most are metadata

1403
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,720
but sometimes we we upload the the pdf

1404
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,599
the resource as well

1405
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,079
so as as you can see is is a very a

1406
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,440
small

1407
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,319
and repository that select content for a

1408
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,200
specialized

1409
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:12,839
community of uh experts speaking

1410
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,760
different languages from different

1411
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:19,520
geographies so we pull resources from

1412
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,920
a number of different sources

1413
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,520
and improve the quality of native

1414
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,359
metadata

1415
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,880
and the same time we also encourage

1416
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:30,160
partners to

1417
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,559
publish metadata and better metadata

1418
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,839
so in our library we adopt a customized

1419
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,960
version of the

1420
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:40,400
meaningful bibliographic metadata m2b

1421
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,400
to provide users even more

1422
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,119
information about the the resources that

1423
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:49,040
exist in them in the library so this

1424
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:52,240
um custom adjustments to the

1425
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:54,319
m2b um

1426
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,800
include for instance making some fields

1427
00:53:54,319 --> 00:54:00,240
mandatory such as the

1428
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:04,319
the subject field and

1429
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:07,359
mainly because we also create um

1430
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:09,200
a a semantic set of

1431
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,800
controlled vocabulary on land which is

1432
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,520
part of other vocab we'll explain in a

1433
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,839
few minutes

1434
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,240
so we also assure the quality of this

1435
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:17,760
metadata by including license language

1436
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,400
geographical focus that is very

1437
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,960
important for our audience

1438
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,440
and for the value of the metadata fields

1439
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,960
we use

1440
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:31,839
standard codes such as the the the

1441
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:34,559
eso 300 100 3160 c's

1442
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:36,000
one alpha three codes for countries or

1443
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,599
the unm

1444
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,640
49 code for areas and regions

1445
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:45,920
and as i said before for the subjects

1446
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:49,520
we use agrovoc and in particular

1447
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,520
um a sub

1448
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:54,480
schema of agrowork called lanvok is a

1449
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,520
small

1450
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,160
300 set of

1451
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,520
keywords or concept highly relevant to

1452
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:05,280
the small sector

1453
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:08,319
that we serve and so we contributed

1454
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:12,240
developing landmark and maintaining

1455
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:13,359
landform within agroc up to my colleague

1456
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:17,280
now that explains

1457
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:21,760
the data flow thank you very much

1458
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:24,720
so in the next slide

1459
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,280
so here uh in this slide i want to show

1460
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,480
you

1461
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,960
how data flow when we import information

1462
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:34,319
from some parties into the lan port

1463
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,559
so at the beginning we have the sources

1464
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:38,160
sources that could be very different

1465
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:42,480
from mono generated

1466
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:44,079
excel file that follows a structure that

1467
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,040
is shared in the in the lamp portal

1468
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,640
website

1469
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:52,319
to adjacent respond from

1470
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:55,440
cms as wordpress uh or

1471
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,680
xml respond from a dspace for instance

1472
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,440
the

1473
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:02,160
dsps api so we have this

1474
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,040
as the source in the b in the middle we

1475
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,359
we have

1476
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,720
what we call the importers that are

1477
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:10,160
piece of software

1478
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:13,520
that mapping the map to things

1479
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:15,760
we need to map the fields itself so a

1480
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:19,040
field in the source will be

1481
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:22,079
filled in the in the lampportal

1482
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:24,640
metadata it could be some of them

1483
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,599
and also we need also to to map the

1484
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,720
values

1485
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,440
because we are using several closed

1486
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,280
lists

1487
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,040
in the ram portal and we need to do some

1488
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,720
kind of mapping between the two

1489
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:39,200
the two values and finally in order to

1490
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,040
ingest this information into the lamp.

1491
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:44,480
that is a drupal website

1492
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,240
we use the fit important feature

1493
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,839
and during this whole process during the

1494
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,920
whole process

1495
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:52,079
there are tasks of data correlation so

1496
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,079
if we

1497
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,160
we see that there is an issue with with

1498
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:59,520
the metadata or with a value

1499
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:02,240
we contact directly our partners our

1500
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:05,040
the data providers in order to raise

1501
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,440
this potential issue

1502
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,480
something that is important to highlight

1503
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,440
that it's in

1504
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,400
in the land portal we are trying to not

1505
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,079
uh host

1506
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,760
pdfs we are not trying to host the

1507
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,319
publications we are

1508
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,280
always trying to point back to the

1509
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:22,640
source

1510
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:27,520
and we only try to collect the metadata

1511
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:30,720
not the pdfs so in the next slide

1512
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,240
we can see some of the challenge that we

1513
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,040
are we are facing

1514
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,680
as uh my previous colleagues mentioned i

1515
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,799
think that is

1516
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:42,400
more or less the same that

1517
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:45,440
we have very different sources so

1518
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,559
as as we need to deal with different uh

1519
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,640
sources

1520
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:53,359
um some common challenges arise

1521
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:55,760
so the first thing is to find relevant

1522
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:58,400
relevant information

1523
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,559
because our sector is really small so

1524
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,480
trying to find information is

1525
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,960
is not easy after that it was

1526
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,160
okay this source is is interesting i

1527
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,440
have relevant

1528
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,079
information so what can we do how many

1529
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,160
documents

1530
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:18,160
this source have so if there are

1531
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,559
too many maybe we can go to a machine

1532
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,480
approach

1533
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,640
working with some kind of software uh

1534
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,839
python importers or maybe we need just

1535
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,599
to to fill

1536
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,920
uh the metadata and spreadsheet and

1537
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:34,000
ingest it

1538
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:35,119
and uh well the cms is that

1539
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,200
[Music]

1540
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,960
the content management systems that are

1541
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:42,880
behind

1542
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:46,880
the organizations the data providers are

1543
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,880
very different in terms of

1544
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,079
of the cms itself or maybe it could be

1545
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:55,119
an html page

1546
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:57,119
and also the version and

1547
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,240
working with different cms and different

1548
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,280
versions

1549
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:05,440
make us to change the approach

1550
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:07,760
each time and also the type of

1551
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,640
format the data format of the source

1552
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,920
could be like

1553
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:16,000
rtf csv xml

1554
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,240
json files ris very different

1555
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,200
also the metadata mapping we need to do

1556
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,559
one by one

1557
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:26,319
okay this field imagine that

1558
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:30,079
in the sort we have um a dc

1559
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:32,559
contributor maybe in our website

1560
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,079
could be or should be a an author we

1561
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:35,920
need to do this kind of mapping and also

1562
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:39,280
the data values

1563
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:43,599
um another challenge that we have

1564
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:47,040
is the multilingualism mainly

1565
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,640
for the data creation because we can

1566
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,720
start more or less

1567
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,640
some languages but other languages are

1568
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,920
out of the scope and sometimes

1569
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,319
you don't know if there is a problem or

1570
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,160
not

1571
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:03,760
in the in the quality of the data

1572
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:06,319
last to mention is that we use a lambok

1573
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,319
as for tagging the content and not only

1574
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:11,680
for tagging the content we are

1575
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:14,960
also using uh lamvok that is a subset

1576
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:17,280
of a concept of aggro block also for

1577
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:20,319
harvesting in order to find

1578
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,280
relevant sources so trying to map

1579
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:24,400
sometimes

1580
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,440
uh the source to this lamborgh is a

1581
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,760
challenge

1582
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,920
and now i give back the floor to my

1583
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:33,040
colleague laura next slide please

1584
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,720
so to conclude uh we learned that

1585
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,480
what we learned over the past 10 years

1586
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,119
is this is a very

1587
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,640
challenging sector because it's

1588
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,720
absolutely

1589
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,960
fragmented fragmented data information

1590
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:48,640
is is highly fragmented

1591
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,799
and enclosed in silas so what we usually

1592
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:54,799
recommend to our data partners

1593
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:56,000
is to to have an an openness default

1594
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:57,920
mindset and follow

1595
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,240
fur principle so the capacity

1596
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,520
development is as important as

1597
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:07,119
maintaining and creating

1598
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:10,160
common open repositories we

1599
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:11,599
recommend to use standards in data any

1600
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,799
metadata

1601
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:17,920
to show the data metadata model

1602
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:19,599
um establish channel 4 for continued

1603
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,160
feedback and collaboration with our

1604
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:24,319
partners

1605
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:27,760
is more a partnership rather than

1606
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:29,839
serving uh uh kind of

1607
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,520
an audience but one of the most

1608
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:33,599
important lessons

1609
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,359
that we learned over the past years is

1610
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:38,160
that collaboration is key

1611
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,680
so collaborating with like-minded

1612
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,359
organizations like those that are

1613
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,000
sitting in this panel

1614
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:46,240
today in the sector is is very important

1615
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,760
joining forces to improve accessibility

1616
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,319
of scientific literature

1617
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,880
promoting the use of standards spread

1618
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:56,640
best practices

1619
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:59,520
promote and build capacity development

1620
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,799
and and also another key lesson is

1621
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:05,039
building on what

1622
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:05,039
already exists without reinventing

1623
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,760
things like reusing existing semantic

1624
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,559
vocabularies for instance

1625
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,119
and build communities of practice around

1626
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:15,920
uh

1627
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,680
those standards to the help improving

1628
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,000
constantly improving

1629
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,280
and promoting them this this is very

1630
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,760
important is one of the

1631
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,640
most important lessons i wanted to share

1632
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,640
thank you very much

1633
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,680
thank you laura and thank you so much

1634
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,640
carlos

1635
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,240
so i think that we are and thank you to

1636
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,960
all the panelists i think that you did a

1637
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,559
great job

1638
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:45,440
it's uh six to six

1639
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:47,680
here in in the european eastern time i

1640
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:51,200
presume it's 1206

1641
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:54,480
in washington dc so uh thank you so much

1642
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,640
to all of you so we kind of start now

1643
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,160
what we call the questings and answers

1644
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,160
um

1645
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,200
i haven't seen too many questions from

1646
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:04,559
the audience

1647
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,440
um but i will encourage you once again

1648
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:09,200
that if you have

1649
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:12,799
any um any kind of

1650
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,920
yeah question to to for any of the

1651
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:17,599
panelists please

1652
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:20,079
use the chat box and

1653
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,599
we will answer as soon as possible in

1654
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:25,200
the meantime

1655
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:28,960
i have some questions for you for

1656
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:30,799
all our panelists and i was

1657
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,000
i would like to put them on the table

1658
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:34,720
and perhaps

1659
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,680
to have a kind of a round and to know a

1660
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,880
little bit what

1661
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:41,280
all of you think about um i mean

1662
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,039
these these topics i think that in some

1663
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:46,559
cases you already

1664
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:50,960
mentioned uh how crucial to recommend

1665
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:54,000
and and to promote good practices is um

1666
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,319
are let's say in in our domain as much

1667
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,240
as

1668
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:58,319
it happens as well in other domains but

1669
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,760
what recommendations specifically you

1670
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:02,799
think that we could

1671
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,400
provide to organizations and

1672
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,799
to enhance this visibility of their

1673
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,280
resources through the improvement of the

1674
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:11,359
quality of metadata what kind of steps

1675
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,480
would you suggest more specifically that

1676
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:15,039
we could do

1677
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,839
to help them or what you would recommend

1678
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:18,079
to them

1679
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:19,839
in laura you were very specific in your

1680
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,680
presentation right now

1681
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,960
talking about a specific community that

1682
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,039
you are targeting

1683
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,280
so maybe do you want to expand a little

1684
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,960
bit more what you mentioned before

1685
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,559
about this kind of recommendations that

1686
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,400
you are preparing for for instance

1687
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:36,640
workshops or

1688
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:39,440
um publications videos

1689
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:41,039
yes of course as i mentioned the

1690
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:44,000
building capacities

1691
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,839
um goes hand in hand with building the

1692
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,559
the sector infrastructure

1693
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,680
so on one hand we work with the the

1694
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,400
agribook team

1695
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,160
to develop landvoc as part of the

1696
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,400
general infrastructure

1697
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,720
and then on the other hand will build

1698
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,920
capacity through

1699
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:05,280
moocs workshops or tutorials for

1700
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,799
people to improve their knowledge

1701
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,359
management capacity with their data

1702
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:12,000
management capacity so we encourage them

1703
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:13,599
to you to to create metadata to enrich

1704
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,240
their metadata to

1705
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:18,400
expose their metadata in the right way

1706
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,280
to use standards in their metadata

1707
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,640
fields

1708
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:24,000
um that's and again building a community

1709
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,039
that supports those

1710
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,400
best practices is is very important

1711
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,960
um from from different uh sectors so in

1712
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,000
in the landmark community of experts for

1713
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,680
instance we

1714
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,119
welcome um leaders from civil society

1715
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,880
organizations or

1716
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:43,200
a representative of government

1717
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,760
organizations or researchers

1718
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,400
from universities so all with different

1719
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,160
needs and

1720
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,240
slightly different perspectives but we

1721
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:53,039
won core

1722
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:54,640
idea in mind that the sharing data is

1723
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,920
very important

1724
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,520
to improve land governance thank you

1725
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:02,079
thank you laura amita would you like to

1726
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:04,720
add something about

1727
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:06,640
lessons learned on these sites uh from

1728
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,640
her experience a lot of experience with

1729
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,839
researchers and cgir

1730
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:14,640
yeah yes i can tell you

1731
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:15,599
a few things um i'll keep my remarks

1732
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,880
clean though

1733
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,799
um so so i i like what laura said i mean

1734
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:24,160
i think it's really important to work

1735
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:24,960
um within the community uh a community

1736
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,720
and across

1737
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,960
communities so one of the things that

1738
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,559
we're doing is is to work uh within

1739
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,960
communities of practice

1740
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,640
uh and that helps to train and build

1741
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,000
capacity within our own communities of

1742
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,760
practice in this case

1743
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,400
uh it could be data managers and

1744
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:43,200
information specialists across cgir

1745
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,480
but more broadly even beyond cgir so so

1746
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,520
anything that we do

1747
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:50,960
uh will be open to to others as well

1748
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:53,280
um part of this focuses around capacity

1749
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,119
building as laura mentioned a lot of it

1750
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,960
is also about culture change so with

1751
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:59,920
when you're working with researchers

1752
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,359
um you know the the i was going to

1753
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,280
mention the third thing which is tools

1754
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:05,520
and services but really the biggest

1755
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,559
rub is the culture um and that's what

1756
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,880
you have to change

1757
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,480
um and and to do that there there are

1758
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,000
multiple ways in which we we're trying

1759
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,720
to do that one is to

1760
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,200
to to build the capacity to to build the

1761
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,079
the

1762
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,839
tools um to to answer the question of

1763
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:21,760
what's in this for me

1764
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:23,520
that the researchers need to sort of

1765
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,000
effectively understand and

1766
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,200
and respond to um and basically to

1767
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,599
incentivize

1768
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,280
the the proper annotation and the proper

1769
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:33,680
handling the proper management

1770
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,880
of our data assets why you know more

1771
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,799
broadly speaking

1772
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,799
um that takes many forms it could be

1773
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,559
through uh you know how researchers are

1774
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:41,280
rewarded let's get away from the model

1775
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,119
where

1776
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,200
people are rewarded only for you know

1777
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,799
high impact factor publications this is

1778
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,680
a message we're consistently trying to

1779
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:49,520
push out

1780
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,520
um how are you managing your data how

1781
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,160
fair is the data we've got metrics now

1782
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,200
to

1783
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:58,240
kind of you know put a quantitative

1784
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:00,079
stamp on how fair data is so that you

1785
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,359
can start to now incentivize it more

1786
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,000
broadly through

1787
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:05,839
um annual evaluations for instance off

1788
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,720
researchers of scientists

1789
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:11,119
um be you know putting in place rewards

1790
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,480
having data sprints that that our

1791
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,160
data managers and information

1792
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,200
specialists organize on our pretty

1793
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,120
routine level

1794
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,279
uh hackathon you know pureathons they

1795
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,319
call them data curatons and and data

1796
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,319
sprints where

1797
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,719
researchers are able to come in spend

1798
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:27,920
two hours or half a day

1799
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:30,080
with very much hands-on uh you know help

1800
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,920
to make to annotate their data assets

1801
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,199
better so these are all pieces that we

1802
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,199
need to put in place

1803
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:36,799
combined with the tools and the services

1804
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,960
such as the fair workflows that i

1805
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:41,120
mentioned earlier which will help

1806
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,640
um researchers in the agricultural space

1807
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,679
particularly annotate their data

1808
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,839
consistently

1809
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,960
and very easily uh the idea is to make

1810
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:49,440
it easy and

1811
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,400
and you know let let researchers uh you

1812
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,960
know be able

1813
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,679
to to do that that way so many different

1814
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,400
approaches

1815
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:57,839
i would say i see aaron agreeing with

1816
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,440
all the things that you're saying

1817
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:01,040
erin would you like to say something

1818
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:04,000
else about that yes

1819
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:05,520
um that's the incentivization just

1820
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,960
trying to convince people

1821
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,880
to produce better metadata is is huge

1822
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,480
because when you're uploading data files

1823
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,000
if you don't have good metadata you

1824
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,159
don't know what that is and no one can

1825
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,880
reuse it and a lot of times

1826
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:20,000
researchers they're so strapped for time

1827
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,159
that they don't it's an

1828
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,920
afterthought metadata's an afterthought

1829
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:26,560
and then at that point

1830
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,239
once they get their publication they

1831
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,920
they're just scrambling to go on to the

1832
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:31,440
next thing and so we're trying to build

1833
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,400
it into

1834
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,359
the process so that it's maybe more from

1835
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:38,640
the beginning

1836
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,120
like with the usda first of all we are

1837
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,520
now

1838
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,319
um required to have data management

1839
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,640
plans

1840
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,239
so they have to start thinking about

1841
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,679
where they're going to put their data

1842
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:48,319
and how they're going to share their

1843
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,799
data

1844
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,480
and all of that what what they're going

1845
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,960
to produce what standards they're going

1846
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,800
to use

1847
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,400
at the beginning before they even get

1848
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,679
the grant and so

1849
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,480
that is we're hoping that that helps to

1850
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,400
increase

1851
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,520
just they're thinking about it that

1852
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,120
they're they're thinking about it

1853
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,199
they're coming up with that plan and

1854
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,400
that it's built into their culture it is

1855
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:11,199
a culture change

1856
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:13,360
and you know unless it's in

1857
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:15,600
unfortunately in those cases unless it's

1858
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,719
mandated a lot of people won't do it

1859
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,800
because they

1860
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,320
don't have the time and they look at

1861
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,239
that metadata form

1862
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,679
and then the other the other step is for

1863
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:25,760
us to make it

1864
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:27,520
more accessible for them so they see a

1865
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,679
huge metadata form and they get

1866
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,560
intimidated and we are also offering

1867
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:35,040
webinars and and tutorials and

1868
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,920
one-on-one sessions and group sessions

1869
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,719
to help

1870
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,520
educate people and take the take the

1871
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,800
shock

1872
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:45,679
out of it when they see that

1873
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,679
right you can may add just one word i

1874
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:50,640
what airing is saying about culture

1875
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:51,520
is absolutely important so the the the

1876
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,080
idea of

1877
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,120
sharing data is absolutely an attitude

1878
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,280
and we notice

1879
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:00,239
that people for instance they don't

1880
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:02,239
think about the license of their data

1881
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:04,400
and if they don't put any license that's

1882
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:06,080
that's close by default

1883
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,679
so but they don't put the license just

1884
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,000
because they don't think about it not

1885
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,840
just

1886
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,760
not because sometimes they don't want to

1887
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:14,800
share the data so it's really

1888
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,400
changing the attitude of how people

1889
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,159
deal with data and they don't think

1890
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:21,760
about

1891
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:23,679
sharing a data management plan before

1892
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,280
they start working on a publication when

1893
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,000
they finish a publication they think

1894
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:29,520
their job is

1895
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,400
done and and they don't realize that if

1896
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,679
they don't

1897
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:37,199
share it they don't make it open then

1898
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:39,360
it's not really useful right

1899
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:41,360
37 whether you would like you had a

1900
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,640
specific dislike about all these but i

1901
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,679
don't know whether you would like to add

1902
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,080
something more

1903
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:47,600
yes i would like to add something i

1904
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:50,480
really agree about

1905
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:52,480
uh the reach the asking for rich

1906
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:55,679
metadata and especially

1907
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:58,239
to make that available but i want to

1908
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,840
add something about the technology so i

1909
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:03,600
think that in this sector we are

1910
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:05,360
very late we are still talking about uh

1911
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,440
sharing the data and making data

1912
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,080
available while that should be given for

1913
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,640
granted

1914
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,679
tim berners-lee 20 years ago was talking

1915
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,440
about

1916
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,199
publishing your data make raw data

1917
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:18,080
available and so over

1918
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,880
now we live in the area of uh the

1919
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,880
technology

1920
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,199
so what we should really think is not

1921
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:26,320
only sharing the data but it's

1922
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:29,040
sharing the data in a way that machines

1923
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,480
can do a better job with the data so for

1924
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,960
example using standard metadata

1925
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:35,120
properties of course allows the machine

1926
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:37,040
to better understand what's going on

1927
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:39,280
without using very sophisticated

1928
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,600
algorithms that need training datasets

1929
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:42,239
and

1930
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,480
specialized id knowledge then for

1931
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,960
example also relying on vocabularies

1932
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,000
existing vocabularies or aligning your

1933
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,239
vocabulary

1934
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,760
with existing vocabularies can help of

1935
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:53,760
course connecting

1936
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,360
resources can help data discover you can

1937
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,000
update a representation

1938
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:59,760
so the usage of vocabulary is uri so

1939
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,679
once there are alignments then

1940
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,360
we solve a lot of issues with

1941
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:05,040
understanding the meaning of the data

1942
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,159
with the possibility to link things

1943
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,320
together

1944
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:09,920
uh and then when you publish the data

1945
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:12,400
for example on a website

1946
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,840
the possibility to annotate pages with

1947
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,679
schema.org

1948
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,960
and using metadata so that search

1949
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:19,280
engines can understand

1950
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,400
what's going on in your website or if

1951
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:22,880
you have an api

1952
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:25,199
like document your api in a machine

1953
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,480
readable way or using tools like

1954
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:31,120
swagger so overall i

1955
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,159
understand that we have 20 years of

1956
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,159
delay because

1957
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,440
we still have to face with problems

1958
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:38,080
related to

1959
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,120
making that available while we should

1960
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,600
address

1961
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,320
the next step the next series of

1962
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,640
problems like

1963
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,239
making data available for machines so to

1964
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,600
solve a lot of other issues that we have

1965
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:50,159
now

1966
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,719
right right carlos i don't know whether

1967
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,440
you would i

1968
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:54,960
like to to say something about what

1969
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,840
febreze was mentioning i saw that you

1970
01:13:54,960 --> 01:14:00,719
were

1971
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:03,760
listening very carefully or yes

1972
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:06,239
um yeah just

1973
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:08,880
i was thinking about uh we were talking

1974
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:11,360
about a lot about reinventing the wheel

1975
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,159
all the time that we don't reinvent the

1976
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,760
wheel

1977
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:15,520
but we're thinking more about not

1978
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,560
tripping on the same stone

1979
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:22,159
and we are facing the same challenge

1980
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:23,199
the same different people in several

1981
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,520
places

1982
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:27,600
so maybe something that to think about

1983
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,239
is to have a kind of session about what

1984
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,600
are the

1985
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:34,960
lesson learned and what are the

1986
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:38,159
the the actually the the the

1987
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,040
the issues that arises in in every kind

1988
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:42,880
of integration

1989
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:45,280
because i think that fabricio and i we

1990
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,239
we get the same errors from different

1991
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,400
places

1992
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:49,679
um sometimes you have this lesson

1993
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,800
learned somewhere

1994
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:56,159
you you will overcome this

1995
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,159
these issues faster

1996
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,840
right so this brings me to another

1997
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:06,000
question that is more about

1998
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:08,880
a suggestion so because i see that

1999
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,080
we all have the same problems in a very

2000
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:14,560
similar way so i'm just

2001
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:16,480
thinking what um what kind of next steps

2002
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,640
we could take as leaders of

2003
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,960
of of important information systems in

2004
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:24,239
agricultural sciences

2005
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:27,280
to join forces to to really uh

2006
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:31,760
um work on um

2007
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:34,320
together to to to to um

2008
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,600
to let's say overcome with this this

2009
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,199
these challenges or

2010
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,600
there is any activity do you think that

2011
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:42,800
we there is any kind of uh

2012
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:45,040
um context where you think that we could

2013
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,239
simply make sure that there is this

2014
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,640
duplication that even

2015
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:49,840
carlos is mentioning in another area but

2016
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:52,880
in general that we are

2017
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:55,840
finding ourselves in different areas

2018
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,920
could be shared lessons learned sharing

2019
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,440
standardization of data i'm so i would

2020
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,760
have walked all over the place so

2021
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,960
what makes me very happy since uh

2022
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,320
eventually

2023
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,400
i'm the aggravate manager and i'm

2024
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:09,840
working as well with nalt

2025
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:13,360
to map both vocabularies so this is very

2026
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:16,000
very uh important at the moment but

2027
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:19,040
there is any anything that you think

2028
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,080
that we could um work together i know

2029
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,560
that for instance

2030
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:24,239
uh if i was working with laura in doing

2031
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,280
capacity development activities we are

2032
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:27,520
supporting

2033
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,640
uh the alarm portal as much as we can

2034
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:31,199
also

2035
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:33,120
with inl we are working on this mapping

2036
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:36,239
i was mentioning with nida

2037
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:39,120
we are also working in some some areas

2038
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:40,239
related to mapping ontologies in cir and

2039
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:43,280
et cetera et cetera

2040
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:44,800
this one of some of the areas but do you

2041
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,199
have anything else in mind that you

2042
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,800
could

2043
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:48,239
you think that we could do together to

2044
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,960
improve this situation

2045
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:52,560
that we put on the table today i have a

2046
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,719
thought about that and it actually

2047
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,000
relates in part to something someone

2048
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:59,120
just typed in the chat

2049
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,800
about dealing with rigorous standards

2050
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:03,440
and metadata standards for

2051
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,120
different subject areas and that's one

2052
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,440
challenge that we have we're dealing

2053
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,960
with genomics data and life cycle

2054
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:12,560
assessment data and

2055
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:16,080
geospatial data and it's all ag related

2056
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,880
but in the ag cross example that i

2057
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:20,640
showed in my

2058
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:23,679
in my slide may be finding ways to find

2059
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,199
where the subject specific um people are

2060
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,600
keeping their data

2061
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:29,280
and finding ways to standardize it in

2062
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,080
order to make it more findable but then

2063
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,239
to point back

2064
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,239
so that they don't have to necessarily

2065
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,199
conform to one standard and i think

2066
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:37,280
medha

2067
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:38,239
mentioned this in her presentation that

2068
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,760
we can't

2069
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:42,480
it you can't make one one size fits all

2070
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,520
it doesn't

2071
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,320
and so what we should be doing is trying

2072
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,560
to figure out

2073
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,920
who's searching what are they trying to

2074
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,679
accomplish and then

2075
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,679
getting together and figuring out how we

2076
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:57,040
can facilitate that so whether it's

2077
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:59,280
using a standard vocabulary to integrate

2078
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,199
into one platform that people can search

2079
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:03,679
and then go off into their subject

2080
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:06,560
specific

2081
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:08,560
maybe something to something like that i

2082
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,320
mean we do that to a lesser degree i

2083
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,480
mean we're focusing on u.s

2084
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,840
united states data usda data

2085
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,159
specifically but

2086
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,520
um some of you are aggregating what we

2087
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:20,080
collect and so

2088
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,719
if we can feed into that i would love to

2089
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,280
know

2090
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:25,040
what would make it easier as you're

2091
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,280
taking in our data to make it more

2092
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:30,400
discoverable you know on a larger

2093
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:32,870
platform right

2094
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,880
okay do you have

2095
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:38,840
[Music]

2096
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:40,159
any other comments mida falizio laura

2097
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,679
carlos

2098
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:44,080
i mean one of the things that occurs to

2099
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:44,400
me is here we have you know some of the

2100
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,480
pr

2101
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,840
you know fairly some fairly important

2102
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:50,560
platforms in in

2103
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,480
agriculture um and repositories and we

2104
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,320
could rope in a few others perhaps world

2105
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,520
bank for instance in a and a couple of

2106
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:57,920
other entities

2107
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,199
uh but it would it would perhaps be

2108
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,760
helpful to together

2109
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:02,800
develop um a framework or a set of

2110
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,600
principles that

2111
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:08,000
that we stamp with with our presence

2112
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,640
essentially with our organizational uh

2113
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,040
presence

2114
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,080
and and float out there as as sort of

2115
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:15,120
guidelines

2116
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,640
um along with attached tools that that

2117
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:18,719
people can choose from it doesn't have

2118
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,239
to be your tool or my tool we don't have

2119
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:23,040
to choose among them but we

2120
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:24,880
we make make it possible for people to

2121
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:27,840
not only see what what

2122
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:30,159
best practice really might be or is

2123
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,679
really but but also how do i actually

2124
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:34,159
make it simple for me you want me to do

2125
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,520
this tell me how to do it and i'll do it

2126
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:38,000
you know that that sort of approach

2127
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,800
needs to be uh could could perhaps be

2128
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,320
helpful

2129
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,320
um the other thing i would say is you

2130
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,920
know in terms of incentivization one of

2131
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:46,560
the things that we're doing

2132
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,960
um that that i'm trying to figure out

2133
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,679
how

2134
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,040
this group could work um together on is

2135
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:53,600
one of the things we're trying to do is

2136
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:56,800
show researchers what the value is

2137
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:58,080
of well-described data what can data

2138
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,600
science do for you

2139
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,280
and so one of the you know one of the

2140
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,800
sort of the small projects that the big

2141
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,159
data platform funded through the

2142
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,080
organized module

2143
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:08,480
is uh you know answering the broad

2144
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:11,840
question of you know is fertilizer

2145
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:14,400
used really really um profitable

2146
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:16,159
in africa we all go with the assumption

2147
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,360
that it actually increases yields but

2148
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:19,520
does it actually

2149
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,719
uh translate to profit and if so where

2150
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,040
and so this was done

2151
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,800
using guardian uh they you know the

2152
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:27,520
researchers a team of three

2153
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,639
primary researchers found uh 200 data

2154
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:31,679
sets in guardian

2155
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:32,320
760 locations and they were able to put

2156
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:35,120
you know

2157
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:37,520
uh use machine learning over this kind

2158
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:40,239
of data pool this these data points

2159
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,400
um to derive some insight and and

2160
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:44,080
actually found that it's not always

2161
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:46,000
um you know even where yields are very

2162
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,199
high profits can be very low because it

2163
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,760
depends of course

2164
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:50,719
as you might expect on on uh market

2165
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,560
value of the

2166
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,400
of the crop on on the price of

2167
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:56,480
fertilizer etc so

2168
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,440
being able to pool all of these data and

2169
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:00,480
spatially

2170
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:02,560
you know identify where where

2171
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:04,400
fertilizer is useful it's one of the key

2172
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,520
things that we you know that's that's a

2173
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:08,080
key question

2174
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,040
for for um african agriculture and and

2175
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,880
we can do that

2176
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:12,080
uh and and once researchers see this

2177
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,239
kind of thing being done

2178
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:16,159
they get really excited about it so can

2179
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:17,280
we then uh you know with these growing

2180
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:20,239
data pools

2181
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,760
come up with these kinds of use cases

2182
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:24,000
that would be very interesting i think

2183
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,880
in terms of changing hearts and minds

2184
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,880
right yeah

2185
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:32,480
yeah well yep right sorry all right

2186
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:33,840
oh no this uh this example is uh it's

2187
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,040
very it's very nice and i think that

2188
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,040
this is the last uh

2189
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,600
step of the chain because as far as i

2190
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:42,880
see now there are two

2191
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,560
two two different groups so there are

2192
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:47,280
the producers of the data

2193
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:49,679
and as we are saying we cannot oblige

2194
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,320
them to use a common standard a common

2195
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:52,159
format

2196
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:54,560
they produce the data they can produce

2197
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:56,639
it what we can do as aggregators

2198
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,080
and agress is doing already that but we

2199
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:00,159
can always do it better

2200
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,679
is to do capacity development with them

2201
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:04,639
when we receive the data with

2202
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:06,080
wrong metadata and in the wrong places

2203
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,480
so for example there is the

2204
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,679
alternative title and you find there the

2205
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,840
journal title

2206
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:12,960
you have to tell them that this is this

2207
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,440
is not working

2208
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,159
so this is the the first thing that we

2209
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,920
can do

2210
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:22,560
work with the producer of the data and

2211
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:23,440
help them to produce something better

2212
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,880
all the rest

2213
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:28,800
is up to us so uh the harmonization of

2214
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,280
the data the media enrichment and we

2215
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,360
have to

2216
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:34,480
to do an effort sometimes we're going to

2217
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:37,760
do a joint effort because everybody has

2218
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:40,960
their own way to to to be funded

2219
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:43,360
so we are also guided by

2220
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,310
what we find outside but what we could

2221
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,920
do is to

2222
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:48,639
[Music]

2223
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,520
to work together to like recommendations

2224
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:51,120
that we can use

2225
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,960
uh that we can use all together when

2226
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,840
it's time to urbanize the data when it's

2227
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:57,199
time to

2228
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,800
give some not truths but recommendations

2229
01:22:57,199 --> 01:23:00,560
to publish the data

2230
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,080
and to make that available because then

2231
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,920
at that point there is the third step

2232
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,080
that meta was saying and

2233
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,120
all this will help the usage of the data

2234
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,040
to discover

2235
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,880
to create new knowledge and to this to

2236
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,239
discover new things

2237
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,480
but as aggregators we have a

2238
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:15,280
responsibility to guide the data

2239
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,840
providers

2240
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,800
and between us even if uh there can be

2241
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,360
like uh

2242
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,239
political and institutional problems to

2243
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,239
to at least

2244
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:26,000
write down some guidelines that we can

2245
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:29,520
all follow

2246
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:35,199
well we belong to a very small um

2247
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:38,639
community so we always

2248
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:41,120
we always had major

2249
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:43,760
uh benefits from collaboration

2250
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:48,239
collaborating with other

2251
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:50,320
aggregators and within a wider

2252
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:52,560
sector like the agriculture sector i

2253
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:55,760
certainly welcome the idea of developing

2254
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:58,080
common tools or guidelines facilitates

2255
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,320
to facilitate interoperability and raise

2256
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:04,400
awareness

2257
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:08,000
and and to me is is also a matter of

2258
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:09,040
making um i mean one of the incentives

2259
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,199
for instance

2260
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,120
in my opinion is really demonstrate what

2261
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:14,320
the consequences of a closed data

2262
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,320
environment

2263
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,520
are what a close date environment will

2264
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:21,360
look like and

2265
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:23,600
why a more um interoperable

2266
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,400
uh this environment is is than the more

2267
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,600
democratic

2268
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,560
so this is a kind of the um the argument

2269
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,480
that we bring

2270
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:32,480
to the table all the times is

2271
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:39,040
making data visible interoperable means

2272
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,719
making the data landscape more

2273
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:44,480
democratic

2274
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:46,639
and diverse we are almost

2275
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:48,239
finishing the panel session but i just

2276
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:49,440
realized that there is a question for

2277
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:51,920
meta

2278
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:54,000
that says can you say more about your

2279
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:58,159
metrics for how fair

2280
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:01,760
the data is

2281
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:04,080
yeah so um i i saw that and i pulled up

2282
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,840
uh i'm sharing my screen again just to

2283
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:08,159
show you how we do this

2284
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:11,280
um so so this is the the guardian

2285
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:13,760
landing page guardian.bigdata.cgr.org

2286
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,400
if you go to about guardian or if you do

2287
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,440
a search

2288
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:20,159
in guardian um every every resource

2289
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,800
you'll see a fair metrics uh linked to

2290
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:23,760
and and

2291
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:25,360
you can go to sorry to analytics here

2292
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,239
and when you go to analytics you see

2293
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,800
something about

2294
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:30,080
um you know fairness across particularly

2295
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,239
across cgir

2296
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:34,080
but you can go to view metrics here and

2297
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:36,159
it tells you a little bit about how

2298
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,760
we're actually scoring for fare and and

2299
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:38,560
basically what that amounts to is that

2300
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,679
we're using

2301
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:44,320
um if i click on that download the

2302
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:46,560
the the guide we've got a guide here a

2303
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,719
step-by-step sort of blow-by-blow guide

2304
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,760
on how you get to zero from zero to

2305
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:52,159
level five

2306
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,960
for bo for all of these things for f a i

2307
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:55,920
and r

2308
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,520
um so this is what we've tried to use in

2309
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,840
in terms of how we score

2310
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:01,360
uh it's built on the on the netherlands

2311
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,120
uh archive for

2312
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:05,360
its dance i can never remember what it

2313
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:07,199
stands for it's somewhere here

2314
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,800
permanent access to digital research

2315
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:11,040
resources dance

2316
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,280
roughly translated so we've used their

2317
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:15,520
metrics to to develop these algorithms

2318
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,480
and so each data asset in guardian is

2319
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,639
scored

2320
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:20,159
that way we're changing our our

2321
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,120
interface so you'll see something like

2322
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:22,880
this now

2323
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:24,320
with a very large data management

2324
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,960
toolkit and if you go to that

2325
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:28,639
to that toolkit um at the very bottom

2326
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,320
for instance you you'll see

2327
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:32,480
you can browse them and so if you go to

2328
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,760
data curation you'll see the fair data

2329
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:36,159
guidelines here

2330
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,760
and the fair data workflow uh will be

2331
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:39,840
available soon as well there

2332
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,800
