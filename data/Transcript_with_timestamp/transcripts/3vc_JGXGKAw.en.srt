00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,120
welcome to this lecture on commodity

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,280
mapping i am you and together with my

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,520
colleague catching we will introduce you

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,359
to what commodity mapping is and why

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,600
it's useful

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,439
agricultural commodities are commercial

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,080
crops and animals that are grown or

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,080
raised on farms or plantations

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,359
their worldwide exports are worth

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,600
trillions of dollars commodity maps show

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,920
the dynamic production locations of

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,399
different commodities

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,360
here you can see on the slide an example

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,160
of a commodity map

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,440
commodity maps are useful for a variety

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,079
of reasons including the following

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,879
first of all agricultural expansion is

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,640
an important driver of deforestation and

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,160
forest degradation

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,800
in combination with data on

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,719
deforestation commodity maps can provide

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,199
insight as to which products are

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,600
produced after deforestation in for

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,520
example protected areas

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,760
it is important to note however that

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,159
while follow-up land use provides an

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,479
indication as to what commodities are

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,880
associated with deforestation the

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,520
follow-up land use after deforestation

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,040
is not always the actual deforestation

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,520
driver

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,159
imagine for example an area where a

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,520
plantation is opportunistically planted

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,400
in an area that

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,799
has been deforested by a natural fire a

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,680
few months prior

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,320
secondly commodity maps can foster

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,280
estimation of greenhouse gas emissions

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,759
and removals after deforestation as

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,079
different commodities are associated

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,320
with different carbon stocks and

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,840
greenhouse gas emissions

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,280
for example

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,880
a big forest or big trees store more

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,360
carbon than small bushes

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,439
thirdly commodity maps provide companies

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,439
and consumers with insight into their

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,640
product supply chains

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,719
but there might be many more

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,160
applications for commodity mapping

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,480
perhaps you can think of some

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,400
in this module you will learn important

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,160
skills to get started on commodity

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,640
mapping

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,520
two things are important to keep in mind

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,160
first of all land use forms the basis of

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,239
commodity mapping other than land cover

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,720
maps which show the physical land type

62
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,280
for example grassland and water

63
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,319
land use maps indicate how people use an

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,480
area

65
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,680
for example for a livestock raising or

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,680
fishery

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,560
the difference between land cover and

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,400
land use is not always straightforward

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,000
think for example of the commodities

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,120
that you will be mapping in this

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,360
tutorial

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,519
spoiler alert cocoa palm and rubber

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,720
are we talking about land use or land

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,360
cover here

75
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,000
perhaps surprisingly these crops are

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,239
agricultural land use classes

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,400
land cover maps will generally classify

78
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,560
such crops under forest

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,440
once they reach the canopy density and

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,000
height usually 5 meters to suit the

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,040
forest definition

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,840
also be aware that land use is generally

83
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,440
difficult to map as it requires expert

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,000
interpretation

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,400
some commodities are even impossible to

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,360
map directly from land use

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,840
for example products such as leather and

88
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,360
beef cannot be mapped although their

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,519
production areas

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,440
may be derived from livestock raising

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,280
at the end of this tutorial

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,400
you will be an expert on commodity

93
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,040
mapping ready to do some interpretation

94
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,040
good luck
