Association SDSU extension USD and NRCS and pioneer hi-bred the DuPont so let's give them all over welcome Corey Cronin Casey Cronin and we're seeing such a big value in bringing livestock into our farming operation because it was a few years ago we decided that wasn't the thing we should do and now we're going to excuse me if you guys can't see but you know that Casey and I are going to kind of tag-team this but you know and see the data on the bottom 2007 so we've been grazing the coverage since 2007 the more we learned the more questions we have we're trying to put cents to this in dollars wise because that's what we really feel we have to do you can say whatever you want to do but it still comes down to about $2 they said they said but on the Leopold award you guys in and you know besides Janet could she's a young one but just look at right here cut this in half and look at the age of these people right here everybody on our farm understand soil health what we need to do to make soil health and when we talk we talk a lot of carbon we talk a lot of soil health because soil health is a driving force and if a person doesn't think it is if we keep doing what we're doing the next 10 years we're going to every year we see it so soil health is it is it really a driving force Katie's going to hear Corey Casey know we've got about 775 cows cow cats that we have out every year we run on about 8,500 acres mostly along the river here and pastures and then we we take them back up to the farm in the wintertime and that's where we do all our cover crop graze and corn stocks get out on the field so this slide thought was pretty interesting this is I didn't ever understand that well why can't we just mold this pasture off what's the big deal with that I mean it's there it's going well this pretty much explains it once I got used to that where if you are leaving something you're going to have a lot more to graze later on you know what I then and I really appreciate what Casey and Cory are doing and not saying money wasn't there also but they're really understanding the the divide tenses in the movement and different water systems and sold but I mean not I just think that's something you guys you don't think about that but just think I mean that's and this is something that you know you can't put a value on this is Casey and Wylie you cannot put a value on what the what Casey's doing to build for the future because that's what we have to do you know but the one thing is is so there are three generations to build the lasting legacy so on our farm we want everybody to understand what's going on we want to understand why we're doing this we're not doing this just because it's it's it doesn't cost as much whatever we understand and we're all building soil health you know one thing we talked about rain and everybody's gets everybody talks about well yeah you got this rain we got this rain and so you know 19 inches as our norm but so we these are our pivots down here so in in May June in July we had half as much rain that's what we normally do in the last 30 years so you need the soil health you need to have the good growth you need to capture every bit of water you can do and that's where pivots come in because it usually used to be corn bean guys and we found out where that really isn't what we should do and then another thing and we will protect our resource we we farm we ranch up along this river and we are going to protect that resource so these are some of the rotations but this is the neatest thing about the rotations if any time we can we come back with a cover we come back with the cover we come back with that cover it's a graze and cover Casey so this is done yahooza pointer okay here's a green so we can tell each other apart we can do all here so this is one of the the circles down on the river up above we planted peas on it combine the peas and went in with a with the six-way mix like it says there we luckily had the the pivot on it we watered it up and then we ran ran our cows on it for a couple weeks and then after that we turned in we fenceline Wiener calves which would really like and they were we turned the cows in their cows around the other calves were on the other side of it and the college just went to Eton and everybody just kind of weaned themselves after that we harvested the lower circles the cows went down on that we put the calves in for a couple more weeks on that and got quite a bit of value on it calves did great on it really really excited to do some more of that so you know another thing and what Doug brought up and we'll get into it later too is the neat thing about grades and covers I mean I figure I'll take in 20% we're always going to lead part of our residue we're going to leave a third of our residue that's carbon now it's protection to the ground we're never going to graze it in the ground we've got at least 10% but you guys are snow here so they Casey what you probably kept the calves out of the feedlot for another two three weeks and then just touch once on on grades and younger cattle how they how they adapt where the older date yeah so these gaps well we went to a fence light weeds and your 2015 with the first preview did it and those jobs they just seem to take off by themselves and they're out there on that grass they're doing what they're supposed to you haven't been sending a lot and now we're having out there well this be the second group of peppers that we tapped out and those house they spend more time out grazing on a field that everything we get them up to the place and anything with ever app they'll they'll go after that stuff pull your tracker laying out there that's where they want to be an update I feel it attributes to the best line weaning event get them out early office of profit college students you know there's totally still appease from and you know it takes a while to click especially for me because I'm I'm old and gray haired I listen to it I don't believe it I don't believe it don't believe it's the fourth time I said well you know there is something here but you know all you're doing in cycle and you residue faster and you but you want to leave that third but you want to cycle that residues faster to make it available for next year's crop I'm going to talk some on carbon because carbons are tremendously important things this whole system we have to harvest carbon we have to harvest carbon and what do you how you do that is you do it through plant management carbons the key ingredient to organic matter everybody talks about organic matter carbon is 57 percent organic matter 57 percent carbon so the only way we're going to harvest carbon is we're going to help things grow under their green we're going to take in the carbon from the air so and I think that there's just not enough emphasis put on this because with us we've got a full system approached where our covers you're harvesting carbon we don't want to we want to leave our residue so it's up it's a kind of a holistic approach you know this is a nation that destroys that soil destroys itself so this is the way we were this is the way we were and but now I don't know so what's that grandpa telling his grandson he said I made a mistake it took me about 10-15 years of mining your organic matter but I made a mistake it's up to you to fix it it's up to you to fix it and this is the best way we can do it with covers I'm not saying only farming but as long as we think about the carbon it's just a win-win this is what we've done in our place not going to spend a lot of time this is grass soil sample it was been grass put in after the 30s and so that's kind of what we've done on our place benefits of organic matter water holding capacity is a huge one and then the I just you just can't emphasize what organic matter will do what a percent of organic matter will do we've got to start a great deal of carbon once stored in the soil no store in the atmosphere we need to retain this back into the soil assume us just have to do that so I'm not talking about building organic matter I'm talking about building soils on our full season covered this is a shovel full of soil if Casey's holding the shovel but so what we're building soil so it's residue humans good job Casey organic master topsoil so you know and I never you know how things kind of slow I'm slow but I hang around during Dwayne Beck we went to Montana for a week great week geez just unreal but one thing he said he said when if you guys ever noticed when you walk along down in the in town and all of a sudden the sidewalk down in this and you say boy that sidewalks sunk that sidewalk didn't sink the organic matters building soil so you're building soil so when you walk out in our fields even the ones that we they're grazed all the time with your with so if you manage it right it's just like walking on a really nice shag carpet you can feel that cush well what you're doing right now is you're building houmous you're building organic matter it's just a win-win situation you've got to feed these Doug talked on that you've got to feed these so this is a mistake in 2006 we planted her first field of cover crop everything went 2007 it rained and boy that's a nice field but you know where the mistake was made we didn't pay any attention to the carbon I went in there with a very low carbon no carbon so all of a sudden I was paying it took me about three years after that to make up for that proof so now anytime we talk about cover crop we want we want the carbon nitrogen ratio to be up there carbon you know and then so these are just three different mixes I will get back to Casey someone said Casey and I are going to talk and he said yeah I feel sorry for Casey so cover crop and carbon nitrogen this came from Ray Ward and this all makes sense the one thing you guys and this is where the NRCS has got to help help and they will when you start talking about a cover crop with a carbon and nitrogen ratio what you want I want a 24 to 30 a lot of people tabled why you even talking about that on a cover crop I think you have to talk about that on cover crop but we have to find out what plants because if you get into the middle of August towards the end of August you can't plant a it's hard to get a high carbon it's hard to like a forage sorghum it's too late in the year so yet like a notes is a good one but also get mature so you have to understand how late you can go on this season with Phil your carbon to nitrogen ratio so this is where we want to be I want to be like right up in here 26 to one because our soil is reactive enough I want to slow things down I want to slow things down when I did at the other time I was right down in here and we just speed up these are kids from Gettysburg FFA the teacher he just look like oh the ones a teacher could would the teacher want to raise your hand okay you guys find us find a chair there's chairs around you know these are two good books you guys and I really especially this one any question you've got on how much carbon what you're going to do you could download this as a PDF you can download that off the internet it's just a really good book okay Casey so so this is it's not have all this but we're on this is kind of the chunk the pasture we have most of it you know will never ever be farming because it looks a lot like that it's pretty rough country thank goodness great great but now back to the rotational stuff when I got back it was well I think we should probably move on well we don't have one health road let's just open the gate no moving so well after a couple weeks of that you got it turned in on everything you have so what we've done is we started cross fencing we're nowhere like doug is but that's kind of the end goal is to try to break everything up it's going to be a lot easier to score I run all the cows through us to handle them in smaller pastures like that water is going to present a challenge but we're working on that and I've been bringing them home Casey yes and then this is where we bring home too with this trail across country you're bringing home this is where we run on that home now back to when I got home again when we start a girl in cover crops in 2007 we just threw them on everything that we have around there so they go when they need the green stuff first and then you know they're they're taking too much so now we're starting to cross fence that let them have certain things and then we're controlling how much garden how much we're reading we're taking 2/3 leading in thirds and that's our goal we're seeing a lot more benefit than that rather than just turning them out lesson great let's take a cheese you know what's new for 2016 and Casey I'll let you touch on this this is the helper you can't quite see the top but it's the heifers yes so our first half after is bringing hold a bell run this is a full team right out back some kind of a I don't basically a 38 a lot is what is so they'll grades is down it and we don't control this this is where we be another thing and then this is where they run but there's also a porter out to the last year that was planted because we went back to cover drop the grades on that and then to the north where that this is this important stops and they also ran on that now everything that's covered up to gauge they'd open for them because they they once they got through all this we got covered up with snow now that we've melted off they've headed right back out to that cover and they're dating tourism and hammering away on that again so really really like reason okay you know this is something I did so I talk about carbon talk about carbon look at this cover crop mix there's no carbon what I like is this price here turnips I'm uh you know I think we're going to go to a pod you turn up because the purple top it grows but I mean it cattle will kick it out easy and a pod you'll get more of a tuber on it more relief more of a grazer I love plaque to mycorrhizae the for HP's I don't know if I'll do that again it's just because of the we have we have a pulse crop center rotation I don't know if I'll do that again but the reason I did this is this is 7080 bushel stripper headed Shelbourne stripper headed what if we stumble so we had all kinds of carbon we had all kinds of carbons from that old straw so all I was trying to do is put some low carbon and another thing when that first flush of a volunteer wheat came when I wanted to be able to take it out with collected them so you just take the grass out and you leave everything else alone this is what it was the for each piece had a great year my big worry was is what was going to happen now because with the cattle eat this in case they'll let you do this and they sure did yeah dispensed out and out there there was a live field that our planet that wasn't going to our full season cover with this year next to this and they just they hit open well but they finally capped out on this move them along through that before we got to LOC this is the cow bouquet now there were where we take our gas to and start background you know we had a hundred and eleven acres to this is instead of our feedlot area here not sure but this is the five way mix that was planted our goal is to get out on it but we thought we had more time than what we did and it's no different we just didn't get it done so it's a goal to be able to at least for the calves that we're keeping for our replacements even grazing on that as long you know and another thing in case you already said this but our cattle really under our or I'm I'm the cow but their cattle really understand electric fences I mean they respect and they really understand them and the kids can move a offense in a hurry so in 2016 we're going to have a full season grades this sounds really good on paper and it was will work on paper but so we're going to have a full season graze so this is our mix and there's a reason for everything in here what I was trying to do see the carbon and nitrogen ratio was 32 to 1 that was real important to me the buckwheat you know a lot of people if you got buckwheat if you have wheat next you got to have a two years off wheat otherwise the wheat can be rejected if there's buckwheat and export I don't know probably I like what it did enhances phosphorus the old career is going to go away the and then and then the turnips is going to be a bit of a podge of turnip kale I love kale a half a pound the kale goes a long ways it gets it will stay green until November gets tall and then but you'll see all these after the mycorrhizae association and i think that's really important and I'm not saying we're ever going to have it to where we cut out phosphorous altogether but it's really what that'll do is you'll actually go out and it'll it'll go it'll trade carbon and they'll go and it will trade it for organic phosphorus but look at here the microwaves I so look at the root system 700 times more root system on the micro as I plant and I just think this is something we just have to keep keep in the back of your mind I mean you guys that I hope there's no seed dealers in here but if they do I hope you learn from what I say is don't ever be satisfied but the guy goes in and saved this is what you need to plant you research it and you'll be able that you know enough what's going on where you're telling him what you want this is a wee planter and testable we we took a cutting to tap off and then we always leave the second cut and come back and so the cattle graze this there's about a foot of snow so there's a foot of stubble left I mean they weren't on it very long our cover crop mix everything goes together July 10th we're going to get rid of the okra I like this the it kind of scares you and you look at the plan at the shorter is just shorter brown mid Rhea but I like brown midrib because of the press ik acid it takes some of that threat away or paretic acid and this is our field layout and I wanted to find out so there's a three-way mix known in and then the rest of this we put on we had 40 units of we had about 80 units of in on this and a lot of people said you know it's it's you shouldn't have to put fertilizer on covers and so we just wanted to see so that's the full season graze July 29th there's our in our non end strips there's a biomass 214th so we did a Jason Miller came up in August 14th we did a biomass and then this is kind of what bothered me a little bit because within there's 70 100 pounds of biomass and without the under 70 600 pounds of biomass but you know you stop and think about it the without the end the others does the undergrowth like the forage peas and the and the cow peas and everything they had more chance to grow because they didn't have the competition for sunlight so you know I thought well did we waste our in second biomass eleven twenty eight weeks old I really recommend everybody you do a biomass if nothing else just to find out where you're at so we just took a yard square went out but you can see on our twelve ways within look at the difference there that went away but look at here so 25 to one I said I wanted to be 26 27 but I was still happy 11 percent crude protein but this is something that we've got to get answered and I don't know how we're going to answer this right down here we had 80 200 pounds of biomass left 960 pounds of protein or 144 pounds a.m. so how are we going to get that back to next year's crop someone said don't worry about it but if you're if you're talking financially you have to be thinking about it so what we're doing is we're grazing it so you're grazed the top two thirds you leave the bottom third that cycle through the cattle and so it should be more available we still Jason's we're going to work on this quite a bit next summer we're trying to get an answer to this on our farm so here's our here's a great board and one thing I like about sending down there and I know there's a lot of good labs but he'll actually give you a carbon nitrogen ratio so I mean it's just uh we felt really good about our mix so here we go so we had a yield biomass we're going to graze pounds had eighty eight hundred forty thousand pounds six hundred fifty twenty six pounds a day if the temperatures right so we had forty six pounds of grades and that sounds easy without to slam dunk so we had $147 that's charged yourselves around one hundred forty seven dollars into the cover crop mix so we're going to it's going to cost seventy-five cents a day 11% protein and here we go I mean slam-dunk dollar 65 20 degrees to feed through the wagon so that's one hundred seventy two dollars an acre so let's just write that down because we've already made that I mean that's that we you know so I figured on seventy bushel spring wheat which that field would have gone to at 475 we would indebted seventy six dollars an acre so you know we're kind of making headway plus he left the manure on the field there's a lot of benefit of what happened on the field Casey suddenly he got into the winter and Mother Nature has a different plan Lord we started out well I mean nine times 2020 to put it was back from home for the river sooner and got on this quicker and you know we would have had all that but it started snowin and between the snow and the beer the beer itself it took away one of the paddocks for us but it just we didn't get everything out of it that we thought plus it was cold so they were eating a lot more than anticipated this is a Fischer after 70 degrees in one of the paddocks now you'd say well you didn't leave a third there well that smells a couple feet deep to it a lot in Fletcher but the cattle I was happy with them once we got them up there no summit never ever left it I mean it you got it's just out in the open on the blasters not a lot of protection and they dug through it got to get it out again so I'm very happy with that part you want you know so we've got another one so we got to make sense to this we have to make sense to this so just like right now so you increase your feed is the temperature drop so this is 24 degrees refrigerator is going to take 23 just about 24 pounds a day ok so now all of a sudden we at we are average temperature with the windchill was minus 3 what we were on that so you take that so I take 31 pounds a day did they really need it we're not going to let our cattle go backwards their cattle didn't go backwards right Casey so so this is our average we had average temperature average wind speed wind chill but look at our max when speed is you know so I mean it was a it was just a tough winter you guys tough winter but another thing 36 inches of snow and everybody knows that Christmas what two quarter inch of rain will do and so we were still grazed in this so we had to keep working at it yes and we might have created a few months by me but like I said we didn't wanna let her account slip like I said earlier some of them cows never ever left come back and we were putting out through the language but not a little silence made and then we feet pieces or protein just just so they were given up to keep everywhere and then yeah so it says loss of $35 per acre is kind of what we figured that well but there again I mean you gotta look at it as you're kind of doing this for the future - so what is it going to do this year for our crop and a few things like that it's hard to put a value on some of that go ahead yeah we've got a lot of deer are doing over I wouldn't recommend a deer or until but we have my dad left his Ranger in the tracks so if he didn't figure you need them in Arizona so we use that otherwise we probably would have wore out those snowshoes but a lot of our chain but they tore down our fence pretty much every day the cows stayed pretty good they didn't they filled it like step across that you know it's on the ground we battled it a little bit but these deer they sit there we started on started on the east and give them give them that chunk for their side chops and then we just work your way less than worker we eat candies here you go out there to move fast and they just kind of hang that move off a little bit and then they just stayed on the stuff that the cows were on till we got to the to the end of it that we made they have some good taken out of it so we definitely lost part of it too that the whole north side was it was tough for the cows you can get it it was bit fluid it was chest deep on me so but after after it felt a little bit those house did go in there hey strangers what they stood out you know Casey's and another thing too with this is your side the paddocks were yet all right what's it are would you do it different or what do you think then like how we productions and jam everything about space to get around and everything without number of cows on there I thought I thought it worked out real well okay then we did do a Belgrade this year for the first time so this about 63 acres that it's kind of between the windbreak and the PTR in the water and everything so it stays open to the cows over here so we just got to be I mean every year at discount abused well what we did is we planted it back grass we took their first cutting hay off of it this year we took bailed off and then we decided well let's let's go ahead and bail green so we took that we're going to go build back out and and we have never thought of but I I got there on the loader Cory but all that plug them all has to work very very well you can see how Jesus no is I I was worried about him getting out around in there but and then just like Doug today I was cross that and there's a layer of ice underneath there that leads to put keep a thin layer a on it this year will probably rest it our bowls get a little anxious that right along with highway 83 so it was the reading time they like to venture out or else we're going to bring them up and grade this with them just kind of just equipment for up to three weeks and then that will rest goes for the ended here and then we'll decide whether we want the other grades again this year or arrested much this is just kind of the layout so this is the farm here this is where we build race here this is our feed yard here this is corn stocks this is winter wheat so this will go back to a to agreement cover this is going to be our post even just kind of a layout the thing that I've learned the most since I've gotten back even on the grass pasture group if you have a plan going into something you're a lot more likely to do it rather than just saying well maybe I should do this you set yourself up with some some sort of a plan anything you can go deviating from that whatever but have some type of plan in place I need to work a lot for us because it's so easy to say well yeah let's go ahead and move in taos today or whatever Jeff if you know what direction you want to go with it it's a lot easier city you know another thing I want to compliment Casey Corey on because they came up with the plan before Kyle did come home and it was just wherever they wanted to go and they actually had it where they had a fence here they ran the corn stalks for a while we kept them off of here because this is wonderfully and but excuse me it is not this wouldn't wait down here but anyway so this the full season grades but everything they had a plan on how they were going to raise them you know it's old and like you say this is planted back to Rye I like rye but so this is corn stocks and the and the heifers ran they came through the fence they ran here and they ran here so what we'll do after corn stocks we want to keep our carbon up we're big believers in carbon so what we'll do is we'll come back with oats we love oats we love oh so also come back and then and then we'll actually didn't come back with the cover after our oats so our heifers next year pull teas and grades which that's just the way it works and then here and then this will be corn stocks that right on and then another thing this is a this is a slough area of what we call it where they feed dead for a lot of years and what we do now is we put a full season cover in there one thing to you guys on full season cover when you do a biome out we get a biomass on this and we send it in and the clip it at the ground so all the sudden you say where you are where are your on nitrates that's something you've got to be very concerned about don't ask your neighbor if it's is safe to graze find out find out a nitrate test and so what we were like we were just when with clipped all the way to the ground we're right at 1,400 parts per million so that didn't really concern us because we knew we're only going to let them have 2/3 and then KC as far as will they ever go back to the old paddock once they grade the paddock and they move it will they go back they do I mean that's kind of a good telltale to when you do when you need to move to is if you come back to another one but nowhere every time we move it they seem to go after the new stuff now after we were all done we knew we've had so much under the snow that we love have it for the whole thing for another week and it pretty much even expand out but they they love it up there that's where they want this is just a picture that this is going to be next year's cover so we cut silage and are kind of our goal I don't know if we'll get away from it right cases to maybe eliminate silage but I don't know if we will or not but we really like to plant right back on we're in wonderful country but we really manage your ride we don't let it ride get very big but it's unbelievable to what the root structure will be from Rye you know and Doug talked a lot about Canada and the round you know and so we say we can't do this and but they're doing it but one thing I think and this is what we need to do I mean I'm not saying any of these but this is what we need to do they've got it they've got a number for their nutrient cycling and we need to do that as a farm we need to do that and we will find that out some guys say well what difference to make take half a cap I think we really need to to understand what's going on you can tell your soils healthy by looking at it has great texture crumbles like maurice chocolate cake it will have a smell of the freshly dug potato so if you guys ever come to our farm the first thing we're going to do is we will get some soil i'm not going to cauldron i'm going to call it soil i'm going to ask you to smell it because it will smell if you've got healthy soil yourself soil tell you our farm and ranch fields we should do everything we can to make this a better world you know we do not ask ourselves why we know the answer and the picture's worth a thousand words we've got a little clip here of the time-lapse um that we're going to show and it was kind of neat the NRCS say they put a camera out when the cover crop was just tall and it's still out there right now but they're going to Joshua guns this is uh in the middle of though like the third week in November so you can kind of see what we're up against but you could see on a normal year where we would had a pretty good grade even there we could handle ladies getting beer in the picture we do Randy Halverson it was a contract with NRCS and and and there are a ton Dakota lakes the cameras are still there and the cameras still out there so it's going to be well you can see here now we're getting to the end I mean it's the college route to your grazing right now and you'll be able to see the deer right see there's a deer right now just so you think well that's about enough snow so you can see what we were up against I mean so I feel really good about what happened because I don't you Casey still save a ton of evening by doing all this and close into the soils and so is this so is this a one year out of 10 it probably is that's just like saying is there going to be dry next year well I'm not going to go plant my corn very heavy to that's going to be dry so we're going to go ahead with things and we're going to take the average so you",
