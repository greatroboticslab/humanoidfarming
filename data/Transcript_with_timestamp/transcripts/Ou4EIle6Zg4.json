  "text": "[Music] so it's one of my favorite if not my favorite time of year right now on the farm which is September because we're harvesting pretty much everything is is full production right now we're harvesting tomatoes cucumbers the whole arsenal of vegetables are being harvested which of course I love and I love eating it uh but we're also planting for the winter and the well actually fall planting is pretty much done we're planting for the winter right now in green houses and it's a time where even though we're doing all that harvesting the the actual like energy of the farm is slowing down a lot it's relax it's more relaxing than it is in the spring all the pressure is mostly gone um all we got left is just to fill in whatever space is left on the farm with winter crops that will mature by November 7th in my climate and uh that's what I'm doing right now is I'm planting kale that will hopefully be mature by November 7th and we'll Harvest it December January February somewhere in there and um what I'm talking about is winter farming or winter harvesting whatever you want to call it there's a lot of different terms out there but I'm obsessed with it because I love what I do I love growing vegetables I'm obsessed with it and I love eating all of this stuff and I don't want it to end in the winter time so winter farming when I first heard about it and I first heard about Elliot Coleman and what he's doing CU he's a guy who kind of brought this to America at least um I was just obsessed I watched every video I could possibly find about winter farming and um he's pretty big deal because he took a lot of European techniques and brought him to America where it's a lot colder um you know he's growing in Maine which is really similar climate to here uh in Wyoming in I'm sure they get down to5 -20 almost every winter Fahrenheit by the way and we get down to that cold last year we got down to30 and he made it possible to do this stuff in green houses like what I'm doing right now and it's kind of a revolutionary Concept in my opinion because it means there's a possibility of having freshh local food all year round even in ridiculously cold climates like ours and in a really short growing season like ours I'm pretty sure Elliot Coleman is a zone five uh I'm pretty sure they're where they're at is a zone five or something close to that and we're in a basically zone five zone four whatever a lot of that is kind of just a a guideline each climate has its own little nuances but I'm obsessed with this winter farming stuff and um because the vegetables taste better A lot of what we grow in the summertime is actually the same stuff we grow in the winter because Wyoming uh heat loving crops don't do as well so stuff like kale carrots cilantro parsley all that stuff we grow a lot more of it in the summertime because it's still really cold here in the summertime and so it's it's fun for me to do this because it's just like the last little job of the season other than harvesting and then once this is done all we got to do is Harvest whatever we want whenever we want somewhere between November 7th and February 4th which is What's called the prapan period and that's the time where daylight is less than 10 hours and plants don't really grow at all um you know you're got to have to Google winter farming Elliot Coleman to learn a lot more about that but because I can't explain all that in this video but in my climate that's that's the date of less than 10 hours of daylight and uh if you figure that out in your climate you could do all this stuff too and there's a whole winter planting calendar which I'll put a link to that in the description too just in case you happen to have a greenhouse and you want to try some of this because there's still time in most climates to plant a whole bunch of the stuff I'm going to talk about in this video probably not kale I'm actually kind of risking it right now by doing this this late but I'm going to try but uh there's whole bunch of stuff you can grow to be mature by November and then eat it all winter and if you're in the South it's just going to be a hell of a lot easier for you than what I'm doing here um I think if you're in like South Carolina you could probably grow broccoli through the winter and stuff you know we have an extreme climate here so we have to be pretty picky about what we grow but there's still a good 10 10 crops I could eat fresh in January and I'm just obsessed with that I think it's such a game changer that I I want to see more people doing it and that's why I'm making this video I want to talk about it and uh if you find any of that interesting keep watching I'm going to share a couple tips that you could do if you have a greenhouse of some kind or even if you don't and I'm going to go over the crops that we're planting right now to harvest in January so stay tuned and enjoy so this is my personal favorite winter crop it's called claytonia or miners lettuce it's this really weird looking salad green that actually grows in the mountains right around here in Wyoming in the Rocky Mountains Colorado Montana I've had ranchers come to my booth in the winter time and ab absolutely recognize this plant cuz they've seen it in the mountains when they're taking horses and cattle up there and it's delicious it's super weird uh it looks like I'm sure I'll do videos later on when this is mature because this is already too late to seed more of this so we got plants in Paper Pot trays that we'll transplant into ground later on but it's one of my favorites because it tastes delicious and it is unbelievably tough this stuff went through -30 last year without batting an eyelash nothing happened to it it was fine um it's a little tricky to grow uh it's hard to get it to germinate real thick um so I kind of germinate it like I germinate carrots which means I pay attention to it a lot the first week that it's seated in the ground and then this year I'm trying it in Paper Pot trays so I have extra just in case the stuff in the ground doesn't germinate well and I could just plant these plants um but it's so good it tastes like lettuce a lot like lettuce and like um maybe like a sunflower choot combined or something um but it's so cold hearty that's why it grows in the mountains around here it gets really cold in the mountains and it's just awesome um we're going to grow three or four beds of it this year uh just because it's so popular and it works as like a lettuce in the winter time cuz real lettuce is a lot harder to do in the winter I'm going to try some real lettuce but it's tougher I've had a lot more problems with it but claytonia is a awesome one you buy one seed packet it'll last you a couple years because the seeds are ridiculously small um and they uh it is kind of expensive but it's awesome um just because of it's as tough as spinach if not more and gives you tons of salad um we'll be doing lots of videos about it later on this year showing you the harvesting process and everything but miner's lettuce is a you've got to grow it if you have a greenhouse of any kind just throw some seeds in the ground if you're Le if you're like a zone six or lower than me you probably still plant it right now for a couple more weeks but um this one was seated uh like a week ago about 10 days ago so that's like September 1st for me um it's September 12th now so probably a little too late for most people but still worth looking into you could probably plant it into October in some CL in most climates south of here but awesome one to do so this is parsley uh I've already talked about it a bunch in my other videos but we grow a lot of parsley here and the reason is is it's ridiculously cold hearty grows really well in cold temperatures which we have a lot of here so I've had parsley in my greenh houses for the past three years and it almost always survives perfectly through the winter um and what I mean by survive is it's like if it's -30 I'm going to want to harvest all of this before that because it will get pretty damaged in unheated Greenhouse like this but it'll still survive and it'll grow back really thick in March and April so you get tons of harvests up until that really big cold snap and then it goes dormant for a little while and then it comes back like crazy once we get more than 10 hours of daylight again in February so parsley's a bombproof one it's more bombproof than cilantro my experience and it tastes really sweet and delicious so I love it I mean I've talked about it a lot already on this channel I don't want to go over it again and again and again but there's a reason why we plant it all the time because it takes a long time to grow a lot of people don't have it in their Gardens reliably and it just turns into this big bush of delicious Herby goodness so that's parsley all right so here's a crop you're going to hear me talk about a million times on this channel I already have talked about it a million times and that is spinach number one winter crop plant it it goes through ne30 no problem it tastes ridiculously sweet once it gets cold and we'll get two or three cuts out of this one bed we have nine beds this year in the far on the farm that we'll be harvesting from uh so far six are planted we started planting this a week ago now about 10 days ago this spinach is about 10 days old and it'll be huge by November just big plants this will just be a carpet of spinach and it's a bombproof one you got to do it if you're winter growing no matter where you are just got to do it um and you know it's relatively easy once you start getting colder nighttime temperatures it germinates no problem we don't have to worry about it too much and uh just amazing so uh this one it's the number one you got to do in the winter time um can't lose with spinach so definitely try spinach so on either side of me are carrots they were planted around August 1st in my climate that's the day that I got to get all my winter carrots planted or else it's pretty much not going to be enough time in the growing season to get them big enough by November but these are going to be perfect this is the best batch I've had so far in my farming career we've got six beds of winter carrots in these two caterpillar tunnels and um this is like for my booth in the winter time this is what brings people back every week is winter carrots call them candy carrots they taste like they're sugar injected into them because they are unbelievably sweet um and I think part of that is the variety we're growing but they just get sweeter and sweeter as the winter comes and uh once you get good at growing carrots which I'm going to talk about a lot on this channel because I think it's easiest way to fill your fridge root seller whatever you got to store food um by growing a garden but um once you can grow carrots well you could do this no problem because it's the same technique is growing them in the summer it's just getting the timing right and growing them under a little bit of pro protection so carrots are a must got to do carrots so the last one I'm GNA talk about is kale which is what I was planting at the beginning of this video and it's getting watered in right now and I'm getting watered in too uh so I'm going to make this quick but kale is a real good one too it's bombproof um not quite as bombproof as like spinach and clonia I found that it gets pretty wacky like past -2 it's pretty rough and when it girl back it usually goes to seed in March and April but I always try it cuz sometimes you have a mild winter and you might get a really nice Harvest through January or whatever and this is literally just the same kale I grow outside it's called winter boore I've tried the special winter kale before and I don't really think it tastes that good um personally and it just gets kind of weird but I'll probably try it again eventually because I think part of that just my soil is still getting good but kale um we planted this like Late July we seeded it J Late July and these plants are not super healthy that's cuz my Nursery is not so good yet but um I'm pretty sure this will work uh something we'll we'll Harvest something by November um but uh yeah you got to try kale too that's a really easy one if you get it growing big enough you could no matter what you could Harvest it into December in a greenhouse no problem so gotta try kale so if you want to do this and you want to eat fresh vegetables in January it really helps to have a greenhouse of some kind and there's ways to do it with a cold frame uh depending on your climate it works for sure but um a greenhouse in my opinion is the easiest because um you can just fit a lot more in the green housee you know a Cold Frame you're going to have you know a 4x4 little section and you're going to eat that all up by in like a week you know the one thing about winter growing or harvesting is you need a lot of space because nothing is growing so if you want to actually eat spinach all winter you need a lot of it in a protected environment so a little Greenhouse like what I have behind me um these are called caterpillar tunnels by farmer friend I'll leave a link to them in the description um these are so cheap uh compared to to a high tunnel which is what I grow a lot of my stuff in these are so cheap and easy to put up any Homesteader could do it um and it's just a couple thousand dollars or something as opposed to a lot more money and a lot more time to build a high tunnel um a real high tunnel you know takes a 100 hours or something to build and that depends on which size you want it doesn't necessarily take a 100 hours but in my opinion it's a lot more effort and a lot more stressful to build than one of these things um you know these things I have them in the 100t by 16t lengths there's two of them on the farm but I'm a farm so I need it as big as possible but you could get them as small as 25 foot and 14 foot wide you can put that up in a weekend and um they ship it to you in a kit you don't have to really do any thinking they do all of the they have the um how to assemble uh packet in the packaging and it's really easy to put together it is these took me about 10 hours to put together and that's the same amount of greenhouse space that I have in high tunnels which took me literally 250 hours to build two high tunnels so just that's the tradeoff you're getting with these um they're not as windproof for sure uh I'm going to have to beef mine up a little bit to survive our wind here in Wyoming but um if I was Homestead which I'm not because I have a farm um I would build these things and you could do all your summer growing in here you could grow your summer cucumbers and tomatoes and stuff in here really easily and then you could grow winter stuff um and have a whole bunch just for your family and uh there's all sorts of fun little additions you can make to them on their website I just went with the bear bones because this is sort of like a uh low-end Greenhouse for me on my Farm I'm going to be building a lot more fancy ones coming up here but um I I love these things for how cheap they are and um you could do everything I'm talking about in this video in one of these I've already done it through one winter and it worked fine I would just say definitely Orient them east to west because the sunlight and you make sure you get sun in the winter wherever you put them because I oriented these uh north south and they don't get as warm nearly as warm um there's probably a 101 15 degree difference in warmth when the sun does come out in the winter that matters a lot for how well the vegetables grow um and I found that everything in here grows a lot slower because I oriented that way and I think that's why um so you want to orient him East West so you get a lot more sun in the winter time but other than that you could do everything I said in this video you just need some Frost covers to protect protect them when it gets -20 or whatever but um I've gone over that a little bit in the videos but the whole concept with Elliot Coleman style of winter growing is you get the crops mature by the last 10hour day and then you cover them with one layer of white row cover which you could get in a lot of different places you get the lightest layer of row cover um and that usually will do the trick for most of these crops you know if you get down to negative really seriously below zero you're probably going to want a couple layers of that row cover just because the more protection you have the more the crops are going to do well and then in my climate usually there's only a couple weeks of that cold and then you can take the extra layers off and you're pretty good um you know it's not there's going to be a learning curve with this that's why I'm making this video is I want to see more people doing it um and I don't think there is that many people doing it um but there is a way to do it and uh the more you experience growing like this um the more I think you'll enjoy it and you'll learn how to do it better I'm still learning a lot um so but these caterpillar tunnels are very cheap easy to put together I highly recommend you do that um if you already have a greenhouse it should be pretty easy for you to do all the things I'm talking about you just got to buy the right seeds and stuff and I didn't even talk about nearly all the winter crops in this video um because we're still still going to be planting a few more like um Tokyo bana which is a really fast growing brass that's a good one I only talked about the really easy ones in this video that are tough um good beginner crops and uh but all you need is a greenhouse a little bit of protection inside and you can do this stuff so give it a shot if you have a greenhouse if not buy one of these so if you want to set up a garden in your backyard that can grow all the crops I talked about in this video without having to weed or really put a whole lot of effort in every week I highly recommend you check out my gardening course at the link in the description I go over everything you need to know from setting up your garden in a no dig style where you don't have to do weeding like I do on the farm and plant spacing crop planting watering everything you need to know from seed to Heart on pretty much all the crops I grow here on the farm which is sort of the foundational skills you need to do all the winter stuff that I talked about in this video highly recommend you check it out it's gardening 101 at the link in the description and start thinking about growing a garden right now because it takes a little bit of planning to do really well next year because I know we're at the end of our growing season but if you had a hard growing season and you tried gardening and it didn't work out for you you got a bunch of weeds this method of growing is for you because all it takes is uh few short days of hard work to set up and then you just pretty much plant and seed on schedule and then forget about it and come Harvest when you need to eat that's pretty much as simple as it is once you get it all set up so highly recommend you check that out if you enjoyed this video please
