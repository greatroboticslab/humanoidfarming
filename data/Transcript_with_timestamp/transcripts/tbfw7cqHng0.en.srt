In a small community in the Pacific

Northwest, a dynamic company is growing.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,480
This company has served the equipment

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,040
dealer market for 30 years. They did it

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,000
by following their principles, by being

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,600
the best, and by being honest to their

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,279
customers.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,040
Well, dollars per employee.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,680
Um, numbers might sound good, but when

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,280
you're working with a team

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,960
concept, be it you start in the service

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,039
department, move up through parts,

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,840
everything else. If your parts and

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,520
service is doing a good job on it, your

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,120
sales come as salesmen, we we get credit

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,400
for it. But as SA the other areas bring

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,280
it up. So we don't look at anything

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,479
individually because uh we have to look

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,760
at it from the standpoint

24
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,400
of profitability for the whole

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,720
dealership and and giving the customer a

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,200
fair price for a fair product. And

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,520
that's what we look at. And when we was

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,640
nominated for this, it we that wasn't

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,320
even I didn't even know what it was per

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,080
employee. And so we got into the fact

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,520
that we don't look at it that way

32
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,799
because we're doing a lot of double

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,280
tasking around here.

34
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:40,320
Um we have one one mechanic. He does our

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,759
uh warranty work and things like that.

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,079
We full-time service rider. We we kind

37
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,360
of duplex on that a little bit. I run

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,759
the shop and yeah, I do the sailing. So,

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,159
we're trying to uh take the revenue and

40
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,080
uh make the dealership a very solid

41
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:05,479
foundation and then we can expand after

42
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:07,920
