But given all the elements, maybe \"Install greenhouses (structure, irrigation, and doors)\" would be a starting MAINTASK? Hmm... Alternatively, as the video is titled an \"affordable DIY greenhouse,\" maybe the maintenance and setup tasks are the key, with building the structure being a subtask. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think. Since the whole video is about building and detailing the setup of the greenhouse, the main task is building the greenhouse, with subtasks being structure construction, irrigation, end walls, etc. Then, perhaps, maintaining the irrigation and structure would be separate tasks, but in this context, the video was about the first-time build.
